        <p>From the Public Domain Review's top articles of 2023, here's <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/the-landlords-game/">the story of <em>The Landlord's Game</em></a>, which you may know as the family-destroying force of simultaneous acrimony and boredom called <em>Monopoly.</em> Turns out, as you might guess from how brutal the game actually is, that it was not initially pro-monopoly. In fact, it was anti-land-ownership, the product of an economic philosophy called Georgism that posited one can't actually own land. There were even two sets of rules originally: one based on equity and wealth redistribution, the other on... you know. It was also invented by a woman, and though she patented it, somehow it was yoinked by a guy who sold a version (with only the second ruleset) to Parker Brothers.</p>
<p>Truth will out, I suppose, but it's pretty sad that Lizzie Magie never got her due. I guess &quot;Go&quot; was catchier than the Marxy &quot;Labor Upon Mother Earth Produces Wages.&quot;</p>
