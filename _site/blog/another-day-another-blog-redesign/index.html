    <h1>Another day, another blog redesign</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>Been thinking about doing this ever since I did the last one. It never quite came out the way I wanted and frankly, the newspaper-ish feel just didn't work. It worked in my head, and it sorta-kinda worked in Figma, and it just didn't translate.</p>
<p>After reading about Utopia and thinking, hey maybe I should do that, I went a little deeper into the rabbit hole of simplicity.</p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was no Figma phase to the &quot;design.&quot;</li>
<li>I did this entirely live by mounting my website with <code>rclone</code> and editing live with GEdit (Atom couldn't browse and edit the remote files fast enough).</li>
<li>There are 157 lines of CSS, un-minified, with a carriage return between each rule. It uses <strong>zero</strong> media queries. There aren't even any columns, so I didn't get the chance to evolve from flexbox to grid.</li>
<li>I'm using CSS custom properties for the second time in my life, and though it doesn't give me everything I want from the Sass feature set, it's really great to get variables while staying native.</li>
<li>I didn't quite leave the HTML unchanged, but I probably could've. I've been using almost the same HTML pretty much since I switched to Kirby many years ago.</li>
<li>Standard posts have a larger first paragraph. This might possibly be inspired by <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a>, the nicest Gemini client out there.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose I'll enjoy looking at this for a couple weeks and then off we go again, probably with a pendulum swing to complexity. Or maybe I'll just change that yellow to something else to tide me over for a bit.</p>
