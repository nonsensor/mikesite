        <p>My son's friend just straight up gave him a Playstation 4 a few weeks back. I have no idea what the circumstances are in which you have too many PS4s, but there we are. Unfortunately, it had been in storage for a while and someone had attempted a repair on it (for what? I don't know). So after buying a couple $5 games we found the CD drive just didn't want to work. I'm not the biggest fan of digital games because of course you don't actually <em>own</em> them, not to mention the drive sounds like it's gonna take off even if there's no disc in it.</p>
<p>So I did what any insane person would do: I ordered a drive from iFixit, a site with a 40%-complete tutorial on how to replace it. Turns out, the actual method for replacing the optical drive in a PS4 Slim is &quot;just take the whole god damn console apart.&quot; That quarter inch of thickness saved over the standard model comes at the expense of modularity.</p>
<p><img src="/img/ps4.jpg" alt="Taking the thing apart"></p>
<p>I also replaced the spinning 500GB hard drive with a 1TB SSD, which was no big deal — there's a sled that can be loosened with a single screw and any SATA laptop drive can be plugged right in.</p>
<p>Overall... significantly harder than upgrading a PC. But now we have a working PS4 and have been diving into <em>Spider-Man</em> (him) and <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> (me), all for about $50 and some stressful tiny screw replacement.</p>
