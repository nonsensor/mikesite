    <h1>RIP Stone and Wilson</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>It's not often you lose two absolute titans in the space of a couple days, let alone a couple guys that a good chunk of the population may have already thought were dead. So of course it could fix the dry blog spell. These were two troubled geniuses in an industry where &quot;genius&quot; is  thrown around too much and &quot;trouble&quot; is manufactured way too easily.</p>
<p>I came to both <strong>Sly Stone</strong> and <strong>Brian Wilson</strong> late. Obviously both were all over oldies radio and I knew their hits by heart, but I didn't see why The Family Stone was important until later, and I didn't &quot;get&quot; the Beach Boys' most artistically successful period until the songs were dragged out of that oldies radio and experienced in the context of the whole <em>Pet Sounds</em> album. When you get into stuff like the Elephant 6 groups, or Jens Lekman, or any number of &quot;baroque pop&quot; acts, you start to realize that he's the wellspring.</p>
<p>As for Sly… on a visceral, purely emotional level I never felt him the way I felt James Brown, but many years ago I bought a used record of <em>There's a Riot Goin' On</em> and I guess I was ready for it. There are weird drum machines, odd textures, entire songs filtered so there's barely any high end — it's experimental in a way that even the Beatles or Stevie Wonder didn't do. And it's funky as hell, played by a mixed-race, mixed-gender group.</p>
<p>It's sad that both of these guys, even though they were highly appreciated in their time, went through at least 6 or 7 levels of Dante's Hell (which circle is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortnin%27_Bread#The_Beach_Boys_version">&quot;Shortenin' Bread&quot;</a>?), but they seemed to settle into some comfortable elder-statesman status later in life.</p>
