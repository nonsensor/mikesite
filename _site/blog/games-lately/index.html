    <div class="post__body">
        <p>Here's what I've been mashing my thumbs to for the past few months.</p>
<h2 id="astro-bot" tabindex="-1">Astro Bot <a class="direct-link" href="#astro-bot" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>It's fun. Lots of great little details and a wealth of new mechanics that come and go only once. I can't help but think all the editors of PlayStation-centric sites that called this &quot;game of the year&quot; do not own Nintendos and have never played <em>Mario Odyssey</em>. Still, it's nice to see something like this on PS5. They can't all be grit and despair.</p>
<h2 id="silent-hill-2-remake" tabindex="-1">Silent Hill 2 Remake <a class="direct-link" href="#silent-hill-2-remake" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of. So much has been said about this game. Pick a dozen other famous titles of and the writing on them combined wouldn't equal the ink given to <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. I read <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/silent-hill-2-by-mike-drucker">a whole damn book</a> about it. So there's not much that I can add. It's just a great synthesis of storytelling and gameplay throughout, and it's an achievement for so many reasons. It's stressful, it's depressing, the protagonist is not at all likable, combat is terrible — and all of these are intentional. David Lynch, Francis Bacon, *Crime and Punishment *are not the ingredients of a typical game, but that's why it's stood up for so long.</p>
<h2 id="layers-of-fear" tabindex="-1">Layers of Fear <a class="direct-link" href="#layers-of-fear" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a short walking simulator in the vein of <em>Gone Home</em> or <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, and it's a sad mystery like those, but it's creepy and loaded with jump scares. Was it Bloober Team's audition to be the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake studio? I don't know, but there is a huge amount of influence from SH, just as Bloober went on to add their own stamp to the remake. Worth a few bucks and a few hours for sure.</p>
<h2 id="control" tabindex="-1">Control <a class="direct-link" href="#control" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Man this game was a blast. It oozes style. The &quot;mid-century modern but just a little off&quot; aesthetic of the sets reminded me of the <em>Legion</em> TV show, and the story is surreal, scary, and funny. It's getting on in age but I am still hesitant to talk about my favorite moments for fear of spoiling anyone who hasn't played it. <em>Control</em>'s creators describe it as &quot;weird fiction&quot; but in video game form, and I think that's apt. There are shades of Lovecraft, Cronenberg, Lynch, China Mieville, Jason Pargin, and the SCP Project — but none of those have cool psychic combat.</p>
<h2 id="alan-wake" tabindex="-1">Alan Wake <a class="direct-link" href="#alan-wake" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I got the much-loved sequel super cheap and it's related to <em>Control</em>, so it seemed like a thing I needed to do. But it didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, as a protagonist Alan Wake isn't much more likable than James Sunderland, but at least in <em>Silent Hill</em> punishing James was the <em>point</em>.</p>
<h2 id="ninja-turtles-splintered-fate" tabindex="-1">Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate <a class="direct-link" href="#ninja-turtles-splintered-fate" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>We consume a lot of Ninja Turtle stuff around here. My daughter is obsessed. We've seen the full run of the 2012 series, <em>Rise of the TMNT</em>, plus <em>Mutant Mayhem</em> numerous times and a good chunk of the original series. Of course, she must never know that there was a live action movie in the early 90s.</p>
<p><em>Splintered Fate</em> is basically <em>Hades</em> but with TMNT instead of Greek gods. If you understand that and it sounds good to you, play it.</p>
