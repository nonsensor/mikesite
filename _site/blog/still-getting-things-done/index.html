    <h1>Get things done or die trying</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>Nerds, creatives, and knowledge workers in general seem to gravitate toward productivity schemes and methodologies. If you're anything like me, and I know some of you are because that's part of why we get along, you might jump from thing to thing over time.</p>
<p>One of the first &quot;named&quot; systems I can remember getting into is Getting Things Done, probably through early tech blogger Merlin Mann (now perhaps more well-known as co-host of a podcast with a guy who later became <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/bean-dad">&quot;Bean Dad&quot;</a>). The system worked well for me for a while when I worked from home, freelanced, and had no kids. What Mann and others who jumped on the train might not have really grasped is that David Allen (not <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sherman-hemsley-prog-rock/">the guy from Gong</a>) designed it for executives with assistants and both the time and power to lock themselves away for effectively days at a time while they did weekly reviews. The book came with a door hanger. Imagine your kid respecting a door hanger that says &quot;Weekly review in progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Lately, I've been working with two systems that are more geared toward creative minds: the bullet journal and the second brain.</p>
<p>A friend turned me on to the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book">&quot;bujo&quot;</a> after I asked about the notebook she carried everywhere. The thing that its creator, Ryder Carroll, says about it is that it's a &quot;mindfulness practice masquerading as a productivity method,&quot; and that's very true. Sitting down with a paper notebook and doing both your todos and your actual journaling is a great way to focus, be present, and stop farting around with the external for a minute. It's also great for people with focus issues or who have trouble sticking to systems, because you can just pick it back up if you flop for a while. Start journaling again where you left off. No biggie.</p>
<p>However, I have years of notebooks stacked up and one thing they're not good at is indexing and re-accessing information and insights that you've achieved. This is where Tiago Forte's <em>Building a Second Brain</em> comes into play. The core thinking behind his system is almost the opposite of the bullet journal: It's only digital tools that can store and search in a way that enables us to truly offload a lot of data from our <em>first</em> brain.</p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense, of course, and it's what tools like Evernote, Joplin, Roam, whatever were originally designed for — but it also brings me back home to a reason that GTD worked for me: David Allen's core slogan was &quot;If it's on your mind, it's not getting done.&quot; The second brain philosophy extends that to statements like &quot;it's not able to be accessed,&quot; &quot;it's not creative fodder,&quot; or more generally, &quot;if it's on your mind, it's not doing you any good.&quot;</p>
<p>There's a lot more I love about the method but that's another post. But I still feel like I owe a lot to David Allen and his insane flowcharts designed to take things &quot;off your mind&quot; and turn you into a robot that always knows what to do. in this stupid-ass world where we have strayed pretty far from whatever-you-believe-in's light, it's a gift to be able to stop worrying about stuff for a few minutes.</p>
