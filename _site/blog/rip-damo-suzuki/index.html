    <h1>RIP Damo Suzuki</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>As you get older, more and more entire bands will be gone. <strong>The Band</strong> entered that realm last year with the death of leader Robbie Robertson, and it's been 10 years without any original <strong>Ramones</strong> on this earthly plane. Now only the original keyboardist Irmin Schmidt remains from the classic lineup of <strong>Can</strong>.</p>
<p>Damo Suzuki, as the legend goes, was discovered by a recently-singerless Can as a busker and joined the same day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they asked me to sing, I never thought that I’d stay with this band or be invited to make recordings of LPs, I never had such a dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A guy who left Japan on a whim the day after his 18th birthday, he barely spoke German at the time and wasn't particularly great at English either. He had a dream of being a cartoonist, and felt that the hippies around him in '68 were trend-following egoists rather than true free spirits. Can, however, were a different story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody in the band is quite special. And they had different interests in music. Jaki was free jazz, Irmin [Schmidt] was a conductor of an orchestra, Holger [worked with] Stockhausen and Michael [Karoli] was a young rock guitarist. And I was a hippie! So five totally different people with five different directions. With the chemistry, naturally it came together. That’s why it’s quite timeless music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He left after three stone-cold, monumentally influential and still-relevant albums at 23 to become a Jehovah's Witness. But it seems like it was a pattern for him to not be a joiner, and though he considered himself a Christian until he died, he left that organization after a couple years as well.</p>
<p>He spent a lot of time touring with random musicians and not rehearsing, preferring spontaneity — and getting away with such insanity because he was Damo Suzuki. I was lucky enough to see him around 20 years ago with a Boston band called Cul de Sac and he was still a magical performer.</p>
<p>Safe journeys to wherever you're going now, Damo.</p>
