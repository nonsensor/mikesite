    <h1>Diego Stocco&#39;s Rhythmic Processing</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>Diego Stocco is an Italian sound designer who's worked with, among others, Hans Zimmer. He's perfected a fairly interesting technique of processing sound sources with some rhythm into multiple tracks of kick-snares, bass, and clattering beat-repeaters.</p>
<p>Recently he started selling his secret sauce in the form of some impulse responses for convolution reverbs as well as a $10 instructional video, <em>Rhythmic Processing</em>.</p>
<p>I thought I'd try it out.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/siAfTrUsCJ4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The basic premise of this short (under 10 minutes) video is that Stocco plays a rhythm with a chopstick on an acoustic guitar, then walks you through his Ableton Live effects chains to show how he turns the whole thing into a massive beat with tons of variations and atmospheric textures.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll notice is that he's efficient — this thing requires a lot of pausing to look at the settings of the plugins. That's fine, I'm sick of overly long YouTube tutorials.</p>
<p>His method is basically to take the sound and split it, using EQs and filters, into multiple bands on multiple return channels in Ableton. This is a technique I've used in Pro Tools for complex &quot;fixing&quot; on already-mixed sources (I don't have any dedicated multiband processors), but as a creative exercise it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>Stocco doesn't prescribe any particular plugins. However, non-advanced Ableton users may balk at the fact that a couple of the plugs he relies very heavily upon cost money.</p>
<p>There are, however, free sequenced gates out there for VST and AU, as well as a few &quot;trance gates&quot; on the <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library/">NI User Library</a> if you're into Reaktor. For the ultimate no-cost sequenced gate, just place a standard Ableton gate effect in place of Stocco's plugin and feed a sequenced percussive sound into the side chain. Not tough.</p>
<p>Is it worth $10? Well, it's nothing that someone else might not be able to show you, but Stocco is known for this stuff and it's worth a glimpse under the hood. The video is very short, and that may put some people off, but it's very dense in information. I felt pretty inspired.</p>
