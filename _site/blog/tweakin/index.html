    <h1>Tweakin&#39;</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>I often wonder what the intersection of my two primary interests — UX and music — might be. Unfortunately, it usually seems like the main manifestation of this is in the obsessive tweaking of processes and tools.</p>
<p>It's probably natural for UX designers of a certain experience level to engage in <a href="uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/03/why-ux-professionals-should-care-about-service-design.php">service design</a> thinking. You eventually start to think about the holistic world rather than just the point where a customer touches a software interface. But then again, it could very well be that the obsessive desire to have the perfect experience yourself is the driver of that kind of thinking. It's a chicken and egg situation, but whichever came first with me, my point is this: I'm constantly editing my tool chain.</p>
<p>The answer may very well be in simplicity (more on that at another time), and it definitely lies in <em>compromise.</em> I'm just not sure there's a really perfect process. Transparent tools that don't make you think are pretty much the ideal for creatives — for instance, in a live situation, tools that keep you from touching the laptop trackpad. That's why I bought an Akai APC40 controller for Ableton on Craigslist, but of course I still have to open new files, and that's a source of inaccuracy and anxiety onstage. So I've been trying to crack that nut. The quest continues. And in the meantime, I use the hardware equivalent of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfill</a>, something that a layman might call &quot;a trackball on stage.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Same in the studio.</strong> My best purchase of the past year was not a plugin or piece of hardware but a set of $10 keyboard shortcut stickers for Pro Tools. It eased my learning and enabled me to work much faster, especially in the editing stage of a mix. The up-front setup (about an hour peeling and sticking these little nightmare labels), analogous to say, setting up a new project management software, made every subsequent day a little easier. Until I ruined the keyboard with a beer spill. Don't drink and mix, kids.</p>
<p><strong>Same with design.</strong> I've been playing with <a href="www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> and ended up buying it because of the insane speed it offered me in a few key areas after just a short learning curve. The paradigm shift is just different enough that it mirrors Ableton: a program that is indeed a DAW and has mixer sliders but requires a completely different thought process from the old-school Pro Tools/Cubase mentality. Sketch is definitely a design tool, but it's been honed and trimmed back to incorporate only the elements you need for the particular type of design you're doing; in this case, it's screen design. But... there are holes. It doesn't do bitmaps at all, I mean <em>at all</em>, even compared to Illustrator. so I lose the valuable hybrid &quot;don't think about the vector/bitmap divide&quot; approach of the otherwise-clunky Fireworks. Which means that again, my process is incomplete and I have to fill in the gaps with workarounds and additional tools.</p>
<p>So what's the answer? I don't think there is one. If I rewrote this post next year, I'd be talking about different tools but it'd look remarkably similar. At some point you have to settle for &quot;good enough it's not in my way,&quot; but it's still worths striving for the zen happy place of &quot;perfection.&quot;</p>
