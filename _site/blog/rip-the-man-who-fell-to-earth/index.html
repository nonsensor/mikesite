        <p>Probably doesn't come as any surprise to anyone that I am, and have been for as long as I can remember, a <strong>David Bowie</strong> fan. I heard the news early on because I was up late on Sunday night. We all regarded the first tweets skeptically, because people &quot;die&quot; on Twitter all the time and there was a big death hoax with the release of <em>The Next Day</em>. But it was verified sadly by his son, the director Duncan Jones. Suddenly his new album took on a new significance. The lyrics aren't cryptic anymore, just like that. And in roll the thinkpieces and tributes.</p>
<p>It's only in hindsight that I realize what songs like &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Suicide&quot; and &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; did for me as a nerdy, weird, depressed kid. Bowie probably changed my path — for the better.</p>
<p>Somehow the ultimate outsider hero also cut across so many types of people that the response was near-universal. I suppose everyone feels like an outsider, and he managed to tell them &quot;oh no love, you're not alone.&quot;</p>
