    <h1>Creating music during the pandemic</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>I suppose I was fortunate, really. My band's drummer, who also wrote maybe 70% of the guitar riffs, finished his PhD and left the country to go work in Switzerland. Writing out that sentence makes me realize he was the <em>really</em> fortunate one. But what I mean is, a lot of my musician friends had to deal with the fact that they couldn't get together during the pandemic. For better or worse, I didn't have a band anymore to worry about.  Fortunately, prior to 2020 I'd released about a dozen releases (between digital, CD and cassette) over the past 20 years that featured no other musicians but me. So I started to hit the shed.</p>
<p>I've been a process musician for most of that time. Each project, each release, is the result of a way of working. It comes from being in the experimental world for so long. Now, even when I make something that I find enjoyable to listen to, it's still gonna be made via a specific process. And when I make something with that process, I tend to move on. But that kind of indulgence is tough for someone with kids and a day job. Movement doesn't happen quickly enough, and output is minimal.</p>
<p>So I came up with the plan of forcing myself into the shed once a week, and I decided I wasn't going to come out of the shed until I had a finished song.  Talking it out with a friend, I realized this accomplishes a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It opens the throttle on that speed of progress. If you just &quot;play around&quot; once a week for a couple hours, you're not going to get anywhere for a long time. Validating an idea once a week gets you through the ruts and the familiar patterns and into new ideas sooner.</li>
<li>It keeps you from being precious about polish and &quot;finish.&quot; The dumb truth of a piece of music or art is that it's finished when you say it is. <em>Bee Thousand</em> is just as &quot;finished&quot; as <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, and they're both classics of their space. One was made by a group of guys with infinite time and money, and the other was made by a drunk schoolteacher with kids.</li>
<li>It makes you go with your gut. Maybe if I hadn't been doing this for close to 25 years, I wouldn't feel like the gut was a useful thing. But the gut has become experienced.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm currently using this process to create new Various Reasons tunes, always with the further constraint that someday they can be recreated live, but the first work I did with a &quot;live band&quot; style and put onto Bandcamp as Mezzo Cortex.</p>
