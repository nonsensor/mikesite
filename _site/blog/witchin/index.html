    <h1>Witchin&#39;</h1>
    <div class="post__body">
        <p>Partially because there have been vast swathes of my life that went un-gamed, and partially because I have only kept a nintendo console around for quite a few years now, I tend to get into games late. My latest to finally add to the pile was <em>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</em>, the main storyline of which I finished today, probably prematurely due to a week of being sick.</p>
<h2 id="openness" tabindex="-1">Openness <a class="direct-link" href="#openness" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Holy shit it's a lot of game. And unlike Skyrim, you can go just about anywhere. Nobody climbs like Link, but Geralt does a good job of getting around territory. At least until he dies of falling from any height greater than 6 feet.</p>
<h2 id="combat" tabindex="-1">Combat <a class="direct-link" href="#combat" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Like most 3d action RPGs, you can either parry or dodge-and-roll your way through combat. And as with all the rest, I take the latter path (arguably blocking is better since a perfect parry almost always gets you a nice opening — probably just one of the many reasons I'm shit at <em>Souls</em>). But either way the combat is a lot of fun. Much like Link's runes or a weapon/destruction hybrid build in Skyrim, the weapon and magic combo is really satisfying and gives combat a lot of variety. Geralt is a little slower to act than say, Link, but you get his timing down and you feel unstoppable.</p>
<h2 id="using-mechanics-to-tell-the-story" tabindex="-1">Using mechanics to tell the story <a class="direct-link" href="#using-mechanics-to-tell-the-story" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I really think one the bar to hit here is <em>Nier: Automata</em>, but W3 does a great job sporadically. Playing as Ciri in flashback (or her supremely overpowered moment near the end, one-hitting wild hunt warriors) is a fun mix-up that lets you &quot;live&quot; the story a bit more. With a few exceptions, I have very little idea what the dialog options did to my playthrough and that's kinda cool. I guess it's a choice-mechanic equivalent of the open world.</p>
<h2 id="bummers" tabindex="-1">Bummers <a class="direct-link" href="#bummers" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Like I said, something about the linear story that's very cleverly woven into an open-world game left me feeling &quot;done&quot; when it resolved. And I know there's a lot more there I haven't done.</p>
<p>Load times are really unfortunate, at least on the Switch. In story-heavy sections, there's a lot of it. Fast travel feels not all that fast when you can sometimes ride your horse there faster.</p>
<p>Frame rate is not great. <em>Automata</em> is a newer game that feels really intensive, but it rarely got herky-jerky. When it rains in a busy place like Novigrad (which is often), Geralt starts doing the robot. Weirder and more distracting is the crappy framerate in some cut scenes. In a game with so many of them, it's unfortunate.</p>
<p>None of this impeding me enjoying the shit out of it. Even the fall damage thing, because I laughed my ass off every time Geralt died by tripping over a rock.</p>
