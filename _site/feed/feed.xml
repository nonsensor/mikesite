		<title>Font Awesome buys Eleventy</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really even know &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-font-awesome/&quot;&gt;what this means&lt;/a&gt;. Font Awesome does seem to be a pretty swell company as these things go, but even if they screw up monumentally, Eleventy being open source means that someone can easily fork the last version that we liked. I will probably continue using Eleventy for the foreseeable future because I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;plus-comments&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Plus, comments &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/font-awesome-buys-eleventy/#plus-comments&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I added some comments to the blog. I don&#39;t know who reads it anymore, but it feels a bit out of touch with anyone who might because it just kind of lives out here on its own. I&#39;m trying out a system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chirpy.dev/&quot;&gt;Chirpy&lt;/a&gt;, which is hosted but the code is open source and it doesn&#39;t have all the really sus junk that comes with Disqus.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve now been &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/&quot;&gt;self-hosting&lt;/a&gt; some stuff for a while. It started small, with an old not-very-powerful machine and the urge to replace Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier said than done, right? Well, some of the process of implementing a &amp;quot;homelab&amp;quot; is straightforward and some of it is even easy — but none of it comes without &lt;em&gt;escalation&lt;/em&gt;. And my latest, as we moved into a new house, was to implement Unraid on a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of Unraid is that it allows you to mix and match as many drive sizes as you want, which to my ears means &amp;quot;you have the ability to fill your bays with whatever crap you have lying around.&amp;quot; It maintains what&#39;s called parity, and this allows swapping of drives even in situations where RAID arrays might make it difficult. I don&#39;t know a ton about this stuff, but I know that it&#39;s got a great UI, some best practices for security, and a built-in Docker manager. What it doesn&#39;t have, obviously, is a guide for how to make it aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/lab2024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Lab. It&#39;s not that pretty.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer is a surprisingly powerful Beelink mini-pc with a 6-core Ryzen processor, and the drives are... again, what I have lying around. I am going to get a taller (8-space) bay to remove all these rando enclosures sitting around, but at the moment it&#39;s treating me well. Probably costs enough in power I could be paying Google, but it&#39;s the principle. Plus, it&#39;s really about &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;privacy&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Your stuff should be yours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He was very grand, and super long. Just the kind you want to see when you want to see a dachshund. Pretty much just like Lazlo was in his heyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is gone, though, and that was pretty tough. He had a good run — by the time we had him euthanized in March due to his being senile, in pain, and generally not happy with life anymore, he was at least 16 and probably older. He&#39;d been an exemplary family dog through two small children despite his breed&#39;s reputation, and the most excellent snuggler that you could ever hope for. It was the first time a dog had died on my watch since having kids, and you can imagine what that adds to it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A world without Steve Albini</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/"/>
		<updated>2024-05-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apparently I&#39;m only inspired to write when someone dies? But this is a tough one. Steve Albini was a guy who affected me musically long before I heard &lt;strong&gt;Big Black&lt;/strong&gt;, though that was a truly formative experience for me as a musician and a music nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He of course recorded &lt;strong&gt;Nirvana&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;em&gt;In Utero&lt;/em&gt; and was famously rebuffed by their major label. He then recorded the jillion-selling &amp;quot;Nirvana with the punk rock all sanded off&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;Bush&lt;/strong&gt;, who were inspired by &lt;em&gt;In Utero&lt;/em&gt; in the same way that Kurt and Krist were inspired by the &lt;strong&gt;Pixies&#39;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Surfer Rosa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pod&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Breeders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-black&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Big Black &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#big-black&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was the first spin of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXnMAEbYPWA&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Steelworker&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; from the debut &lt;em&gt;Lungs&lt;/em&gt; that really did it for me. Not only was this a song that used a drum machine with heavy guitars &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; before Godflesh&#39;s debut or Ministry&#39;s pivot to metal, but lyrically it was a marvel. He was clearly inhabiting a character. But rather than a purely sympathetic view of a blue-collar man or a portrait of a hillbilly as racist and ignorant, it was a multi-dimensional piece of writing that really got under my skin (much like the &amp;quot;great big thing crawling all over me&amp;quot;). I ate up the rest of the discography, though I got into &lt;strong&gt;Shellac&lt;/strong&gt; a good bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recording&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Recording &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#recording&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent years, I found a Steve Albini recording credit to be the mark of a certain type of band or artist. Whether it&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Joanna Newsom&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Sunn O)))&lt;/strong&gt;, if you seek him out there are certain things you&#39;re looking for, and most of all it&#39;s probably a punk-informed dedicationt to making a band &amp;quot;sound like they sound.&amp;quot; No tricks, no double-tracking, minimal overdubs — he even eschewed compression most of the time in favor of the full dynamic range of the amps and drums sitting in his studio&#39;s mud-brick rooms. As much as he&#39;d deny it, there is a sound to his records, but it&#39;s primarily that sound of Electrical Audio and its walls, not of a producer imposing an aesthetic on bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;becoming-better&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Becoming better &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#becoming-better&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing most people knew about Steve Albini, a perception that he had a hard time changing, is that he was a prickly, opinionated individual with a knack for trash talk. This, combined with the, uh, boundary-pushing nature of a lot of his musical and related output (see both &amp;quot;Rapeman&amp;quot; as a band name and the &lt;em&gt;Forced Exposure&lt;/em&gt; articles that are getting him gotcha-branded posthumously, accusations I&#39;m not really gonna take seriously), made him the perfect candidate for the project that he undertook in the last few years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/steve-albini-counsel-culture-interview&quot;&gt;reckoning with his past as an OG edgelord&lt;/a&gt;. I think it&#39;s reasonable to say that he provides a good example for anyone who really feels punk rock values but may have gotten caught up at one time or another in the more &amp;quot;fuck you, mom&amp;quot; aspects of punk culture, and a template for living with principles. Bonus, it&#39;s a template for all dudes, white people, and cis people who might&#39;ve thought that they could get away with certain stuff because of the way they feel in their hearts or whatever. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vishkhanna.com/2015/11/12/ep-223-ian-mackaye-steve-albini-part-i/&quot;&gt;dual interview with Vish Khanna&lt;/a&gt;, he comes down on Ian Mackaye of all people for falling into the trap of thinking that punk rock shouldn&#39;t be &amp;quot;PC,&amp;quot; by defining &amp;quot;PC&amp;quot; as pretty simply as conservative rebranding of &amp;quot;not being an asshole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;giving&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Giving &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#giving&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albini seems to have been quite generous. He spent the last twenty years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-i-havent-had-a-conventional-christmas-in-20-years_b_8614568?utm_hp_ref=impact&amp;amp;ir=Impact&quot;&gt;raising money and personally delivering needed presents&lt;/a&gt; for the most down-and-out Chicagoans on Christmas. And he regularly shared his knowledge of making records, trying very hard to be practical and demystify not just his, but all practices of recording sound. Not just in expensive meet-the-masters type courses, but in countless freely available videos on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this adds up to a person I felt I could be inspired by, and who was loved by most people who knew him. It&#39;s going to be a strange world without him.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>RIP Gary Floyd</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-gary-floyd/"/>
		<updated>2024-05-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-gary-floyd/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days before the earth-shattering news that Steve Albini had passed, we lost another great of the punk rock world, the mighty Gary Floyd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floyd was the frontman of the Austin TX punk group The Dicks, and aside from being an early figure in non-LA hardcore, he was a bold-ass human being who was 300+ pounds, openly gay, openly communist, and often in drag on stage. And for all of Austin&#39;s reputation as a haven for weirdos and punks, it was and is still in Texas. So I&#39;d argue Gary Floyd was one of the bravest, gnarliest, most badass punks in a genre that even then was becoming increasingly tough-guy and jock-ified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So RIP to one of the realest to ever do it, and one of the very few people to get a Butthole Surfers song named after him.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think it&#39;s probably safe to say that Figma eroded their own trust with the whole Adobe deal, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/&quot;&gt;preemptively killed by EU regulators&lt;/a&gt;. It definitely made Dylan Field look like just another startup founder looking for a payday by selling to a big company. Unfortunately for him, his company made something too indispensible to merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their credit, they have since continued to move forward with new features, some of which are pretty useful and some of which are the now depressingly-standard &amp;quot;look, we added AI to a thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In service of the groove</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/"/>
		<updated>2024-03-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Musically, I am many things, though my skills range from &amp;quot;not bad&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;technically, yes, you are playing that instrument.&amp;quot; But I love drums, and I generally appreciate a great drummer more than a shredding guitarist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a lot of people who get really into drums go in one of a couple particular directions. One is of course jazz, which means that you will probably admire Buddy Rich and Art Blakey above all and if you&#39;re a rocker you&#39;ll try to emulate fusion greats like Tony Williams. Or, you become one of those insufferable prog guys who have never voluntarily touched Black music and just want to be like Tool or Rush. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong: Neil Peart was as impressive behind the kit as he was terrible at lyrics. But to me, there are more important things than the number of hits you can slip into a measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My all-time greatest drummer list includes primarily people who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invented a beat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could listen to play that beat, unceasing, for hours on end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the GROOVE. It&#39;s easy to know when you hear it, hard to define, and rarely as good as it is with these guys. Also, all of them are dead, which is depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;klaus-dinger-neu&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Klaus Dinger (NEU!) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#klaus-dinger-neu&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;motorik&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Motorik &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#motorik&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best name in the bunch. Dinger is the original drummer for &lt;strong&gt;Kraftwerk&lt;/strong&gt; when they had one, before he formed &lt;strong&gt;NEU!&lt;/strong&gt; and later &lt;strong&gt;La Dusseldorf&lt;/strong&gt;. He never called it &amp;quot;motorik,&amp;quot; just something like &amp;quot;endless beat,&amp;quot; but both make sense when you hear it. A lot of interesting bands owe a lot to Neu!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfODdusZu-o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-purdie-shuffle-and-the-funky-drummer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Purdie Shuffle and the Funky Drummer &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#the-purdie-shuffle-and-the-funky-drummer&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Brown&lt;/strong&gt; was a genius bandleader but he also knew enough to get the right guys. He had two of the best drummers in the business at the same time. Purdie is best known for &amp;quot;The Purdie Shuffle,&amp;quot; a basic beat with very little actual shuffle or swing but an insane amount of variable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_note#Percussion&quot;&gt;ghost notes&lt;/a&gt; that give it incredible funk. Stubblefield had his own magic, and thanks to a track that got released as &amp;quot;The Funky Drummer,&amp;quot; he became the single most sampled drummer in history. The only break that comes close to Funky Drummer&#39;s ubiquity is the Amen Break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what both of these guys taught me I applied to drum programming more than acoustic drumming: Swing is an artificial way of humanizing a drum machine, but you can create an intense groove in the manipulation of dynamics (that is, volume) of the different hits. Here&#39;s about 8 minutes of only the most famous samples of Funky Drummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKB2N_Fyyh8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tony-allen-africa-70&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tony Allen (Africa 70) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#tony-allen-africa-70&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said when Tony Allen died that the title for &amp;quot;Best drummer on earth&amp;quot; is now up for grabs. Not sure who claimed it. Allen did a lot of things, dabbling in everything from jazz to dub, but he&#39;s best known as &lt;strong&gt;Fela Kuti&lt;/strong&gt;&#39;s drummer and the innovator behind the Afrobeat. Not the genre, but the beat itself. It&#39;s hard to pin down, but for me it&#39;s also hard to stop listening to. He&#39;s never ever doing a straight beat, but somehow your head can&#39;t stop nodding. His discography is massive. There&#39;s solo stuff, Fela, even &lt;strong&gt;The Good, The Bad, and the Queen&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Blur&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;Gorillaz&lt;/strong&gt;&#39;s Damon Albarn and Paul Simonon from &lt;strong&gt;the Clash&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kisTH3SFegc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that you can listen a single rhythm literally forever and not get bored was introduced to me by &lt;strong&gt;Can&lt;/strong&gt;. James Brown and Fela Kuti could groove for a long time, but nothing compares to the 18-minute album version of &amp;quot;Hallelulwah&amp;quot; from &lt;em&gt;Tago Mago&lt;/em&gt; — let alone some of the live versions that last even longer. Just gonna put it out there: no German has the right to be this funky.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Apples to MPCs</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever spoken to an electronic musician or a guitarist, you know that GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) is a chronic disease. And though it can be treated, the results tend to be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue, aside from the obvious financial ones, is that gear can never actually solve your problems. That&#39;s what all the pros say, anyway, but who can trust them? They have really nice gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; issue, at least as I see it, is that so few pieces of electronic music equipment can be compared in an apples-to-apples sort of way. Guitars? Sure. Tone-chasing is a thing, and a neurosis that&#39;s even worse than GAS, because it can cause you to hoard dozens of distortion pedals, claiming they all do different things. But are they all objectively distortion pedals? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are a Roland SP-404MKII, an Akai MPC, a Novation Circuit Rhythm, a Korg Electribe Sampler, a Polyend Tracker, and an Elektron Octatrack objectively the same thing? &lt;em&gt;Sort of&lt;/em&gt;. They are samplers with sequencing. Most are capable of sequencing external machines via MIDI. Most store samples on an SD card. But it stops there. They range from around $350 to about $1500, and that&#39;s not just the honorable Swedish pedigree that&#39;s giving Octatrack that kind of price tag. They have varying amounts and quality levels of built-in sounds. There are wide ranges in connectivity and numbers of tracks. Some are more sequencers with sampling capability, others are samplers with just enough sequencing to make you think it&#39;s an all-in-one device. Some are very good at both. Some have no screens, some are basically computers in a box. You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in a live set, to replace Circuit Rhythm and Circuit Tracks with an &lt;strong&gt;MPC One&lt;/strong&gt; is more or less an even trade in terms of whether the same stuff I&#39;ve been doing is possible. But what &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; is possible? Turns out, a great deal. More on that another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I going back on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/&quot;&gt;what I say in this post&lt;/a&gt; by replacing the Circuits as the centerpiece of live work? Not really, because I&#39;m not thinking of it as an &amp;quot;upgrade.&amp;quot; I still think that they are the most beautiful, elegant, and &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; quick-composition machines out there, especially the Tracks. But that&#39;s not to say that another device doesn&#39;t have a place in my show or in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How all of this works</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/"/>
		<updated>2024-03-01T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A former coworker from the blog era was complaining about WordPress recently and it made me think of the bad old days, as WP was getting further and further from god&#39;s light, when I struggled more and more with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wordpress-problem&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The WordPress problem &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#the-wordpress-problem&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t like that, as a front-end developer (mostly in the &amp;quot;HTML and CSS&amp;quot; sense, too, not the front end we have today with JavaScript pulling all the weight of applications), I can&#39;t really make a WordPress theme. There are ways, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://upstatement.com/timber/&quot;&gt;Timber&lt;/a&gt;, to make that happen more easily, but that&#39;s yet another dependency and more weight added to an already heavy platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why I initially moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/&quot;&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt;. I think it&#39;s tempting when you&#39;ve used something like Twig to want to have a templating language layer on top of things, but the truth is that Kirby (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://processwire.com/&quot;&gt;Processwire&lt;/a&gt;, another CMS I&#39;ve replaced WP sites with) is incredibly simple and doesn&#39;t require actual &amp;quot;PHP Coding.&amp;quot; We&#39;re talking maybe a bit of logic now and again, but in general the functions are handled by an API that is pretty easy to use. Not to mention that both support the idea of defining your types of content, as opposed to having to bolt on yet more plugins to get custom content types and attributes to go with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for all this adding on of functionality that resembles Legos a lot less than it looks like a technological shanty town is that &lt;em&gt;WordPress was built for blogs&lt;/em&gt;. And yet!! Even running a simple blog is now handled more easily by other tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-static&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Going static &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#going-static&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, and it&#39;s been about a year and a half since I changed engines again, this time to the static generator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;. One thing you really don&#39;t get out of the box with a static site generator is the CMS. But what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get is your Markdown editor of choice. On Mac, that is of course still &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/thanks-byword/&quot;&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;, and on Linux it is currently the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brrd/abricotine&quot;&gt;Abricotine&lt;/a&gt;, but the repo was archived sometime in the fall so we&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does it actually work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tools&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The tools &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#the-tools&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the requirements in terms of tools and platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleventy (the Node script that builds a static site from Markdown files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github (for storing the site files, accessing them from anywhere, and controlling deployment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netlify with a free plan (for hosting and publishing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few requirements on the computer side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node (easily installed via &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; on Debian or &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt; on Mac)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git (or a GUI Git client, which is what I prefer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An editor (even Textedit will do, but why not use a nice one?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you install Node, all the other stuff that&#39;s needed is stored in the repository itself. Using the simplest boilerplate and reading the docs for a few minutes was all it took for me to make the simple Nunjucks templates required to make a site run efficiently. It could certainly do even more than a blog, but without a CMS interface I wouldn&#39;t give it to a freelance client or anything like that (which is where headless CMSes come in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the marginally tech-inclined, it&#39;s pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-do-it&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;How I do it &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#how-i-do-it&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about actually writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the repo is up to date on the local machine using Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new text file in your editor of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the YAML. Posts in Eleventy are configured using YAML at the top of the document, something that is more and more common these days. All the popular static site makers like Gatsby, Jekyll, and Hugo use it, as do flat-file CMSes like Kirby or Grav. It&#39;s not too hard to remember the format, but I use Espanso to store it as a shortcut. You could use TextExpander, aText, or whatever you like here, but Espanso works on both Mac and Linux for zero dollars so I&#39;m into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the Eleventy local server to see your work. It&#39;s a quick Node command and you get a really nice lightweight web server that runs your site locally. Every time you save a file, it automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check in and push to Git. That&#39;s it. Netlify handles the rest, and in a few seconds your site is ready. It&#39;s faster and easier than using FTP to update a static site. Images are the only potential problem as binaries can be slow to upload in Git, but I haven&#39;t encountered issues yet. We&#39;re talking about images on a website, not extremely large files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;however&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;However &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#however&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is any of this really easier than WordPress or Ghost or whatever? I dunno. It&#39;s free, I know that. It lets me write in a nice text or Markdown editor, which I honestly feel more than a web interface or tool like MarsEdit. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been doing this kind of thing a long time.&lt;/a&gt; It makes me feel a bit like a wizard. Plus, it hearkens back to an older, more interesting version of the internet that I used to spend time on before it became the engine that powers the most destructive form of capitalism we&#39;ve probably ever seen. I guess that counts for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to go write my next post in Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>RIP Damo Suzuki</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-damo-suzuki/"/>
		<updated>2024-02-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-damo-suzuki/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you get older, more and more entire bands will be gone. &lt;strong&gt;The Band&lt;/strong&gt; entered that realm last year with the death of leader Robbie Robertson, and it&#39;s been 10 years without any original &lt;strong&gt;Ramones&lt;/strong&gt; on this earthly plane. Now only the original keyboardist Irmin Schmidt remains from the classic lineup of &lt;strong&gt;Can&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damo Suzuki, as the legend goes, was discovered by a recently-singerless Can as a busker and joined the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they asked me to sing, I never thought that I’d stay with this band or be invited to make recordings of LPs, I never had such a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy who left Japan on a whim the day after his 18th birthday, he barely spoke German at the time and wasn&#39;t particularly great at English either. He had a dream of being a cartoonist, and felt that the hippies around him in &#39;68 were trend-following egoists rather than true free spirits. Can, however, were a different story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody in the band is quite special. And they had different interests in music. Jaki was free jazz, Irmin [Schmidt] was a conductor of an orchestra, Holger [worked with] Stockhausen and Michael [Karoli] was a young rock guitarist. And I was a hippie! So five totally different people with five different directions. With the chemistry, naturally it came together. That’s why it’s quite timeless music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left after three stone-cold, monumentally influential and still-relevant albums at 23 to become a Jehovah&#39;s Witness. But it seems like it was a pattern for him to not be a joiner, and though he considered himself a Christian until he died, he left that organization after a couple years as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent a lot of time touring with random musicians and not rehearsing, preferring spontaneity — and getting away with such insanity because he was Damo Suzuki. I was lucky enough to see him around 20 years ago with a Boston band called Cul de Sac and he was still a magical performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe journeys to wherever you&#39;re going now, Damo.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As this iteration of the blog enters its tenth year (and I believe it&#39;s on its third CMS? Fourth?) I&#39;ve been moving a lot of posts finally from the old Kirby system. It just involves sucking metadata out of the Kirby format and into the frontmatter that Eleventy uses, which is something more portable for the next inevitable move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while the process is more manual than I would like, it has given me an opportunity to look at old content. There are some really interesting links I&#39;ve blogged. Unfortunately, a HUGE chunk of them do not work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard not to see this as something fundamentally messed up. Like, we&#39;ve broken the internet somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Promised for a while, finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://zed.dev/&quot;&gt;Zed&lt;/a&gt; arrives. It&#39;s written by some of the creators of Atom, but instead of another Electron thing it&#39;s a very fast-performing app written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s multiplayer, apparently, which as someone who was once subjected to pair programming I&#39;ve always found that a little weird. But it works for Figma, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wrote this post in it. Will be nice to see it appear on Linux, a platform that is surprisingly lacking in lightweight code editors. Between the anemic GEdit and a full blown IDE you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/lite-xl/&quot;&gt;Lite XL&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft&#39;s Electron-based VSCode, and of course the influential but non-free Sublime, which has persisted. I don&#39;t love any of them, but I&#39;m liking this so far.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I knew I hated this game</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/i-knew-i-hated-this-game/"/>
		<updated>2024-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/i-knew-i-hated-this-game/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the Public Domain Review&#39;s top articles of 2023, here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/the-landlords-game/&quot;&gt;the story of &lt;em&gt;The Landlord&#39;s Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which you may know as the family-destroying force of simultaneous acrimony and boredom called &lt;em&gt;Monopoly.&lt;/em&gt; Turns out, as you might guess from how brutal the game actually is, that it was not initially pro-monopoly. In fact, it was anti-land-ownership, the product of an economic philosophy called Georgism that posited one can&#39;t actually own land. There were even two sets of rules originally: one based on equity and wealth redistribution, the other on... you know. It was also invented by a woman, and though she patented it, somehow it was yoinked by a guy who sold a version (with only the second ruleset) to Parker Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth will out, I suppose, but it&#39;s pretty sad that Lizzie Magie never got her due. I guess &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; was catchier than the Marxy &amp;quot;Labor Upon Mother Earth Produces Wages.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After undertaking a ridiculous repair job on our &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; Playstation 4, the logical choice was to start playing a game. Not sure what actually got me looking at &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn,&lt;/em&gt; but it&#39;s one of the more fun titles I&#39;ve played in a while. I decided after almost 300 hours that I was done with &lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; so I did the final boss and didn&#39;t look back. So you&#39;d think I might be done with swords-and-bows open world post-apocalyptic fantasy stuff. Yet I picked it up for $10 and it is a blast. Great stealth, fun combat, solid voice acting, and a mystery to unravel. There&#39;s a post-apocalyptic melancholy to the whole thing but it&#39;s shot through with humor too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to getting the sequel on sale, though for some reason the DLC is only on PS5. Get a PS5? No thanks! I will be giving that $500 to my daughter&#39;s preschool for approximately 17 minutes of child care.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>What a gas</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/what-a-gas/"/>
		<updated>2023-12-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/what-a-gas/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are zillions of one-horse towns across the US, and most of them have a minor story worth going &amp;quot;huh, that&#39;s interesting&amp;quot; over. Mattoon, IL, (pronounced MATT-TOON with no obvious stress on either syllable, but certainly not muh-TOON) the hub of my maternal family side — a town that barely tops 15,000 people even today — has a couple that are way stranger than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these is the country&#39;s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King_(Mattoon,_Illinois)&quot;&gt;Burger King&lt;/a&gt;. The origin story was just that an ice cream stand called Frigid Queen (lovely...) needed a king when the owners expanded to fast food, and the logical choice was Burger King. In 1968 a court ruled that the more famous Burger King can&#39;t have a location within 20 miles of Mattoon, nor can the Original Burger King operate another restaurant outside the area. It&#39;s still there, and thriving as far as I know, at least to whatever extent a little burger shop can thrive in a tiny midwest town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more famous is the story of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Gasser_of_Mattoon&quot;&gt;Mad Gasser of Mattoon&lt;/a&gt; aka the Phantom Anesthetist, a 1940s incident that has over time become known as a textbook example of mass psychosis. Atlas Obscura has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/column-mad-gasser-of-mattoon&quot;&gt;an interesting article on it&lt;/a&gt;. They posit that wartime situations and fears may have contributed to the weird hysteria that hung over the town like a fog. A chemical fog which of course did not actually exist. They make a good case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/mattoon_headlines.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mattoon newspaper front page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this newspaper from the time to get an idea of the national mood. Hopeful but war-weary and still afraid of phantom Nazi or Japanese enemies attacking while most of America&#39;s men are away. So what actually happened? We might never know if there was really an &amp;quot;Anesthetic Prowler&amp;quot; or if any of the attacks actually happened. But it&#39;s a creepy story and a fun one to have in the family.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Entering the last console generation the hard way</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/entering-the-last-console-generation-the-hard-way/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My son&#39;s friend just straight up gave him a Playstation 4 a few weeks back. I have no idea what the circumstances are in which you have too many PS4s, but there we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it had been in storage for a while and someone had attempted a repair on it (for what? I don&#39;t know). So after buying a couple $5 games we found the CD drive just didn&#39;t want to work. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of digital games because of course you don&#39;t actually &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; them, not to mention the drive sounds like it&#39;s gonna take off even if there&#39;s no disc in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did what any insane person would do: I ordered a drive from iFixit, a site with a 40%-complete tutorial on how to replace it. Turns out, the actual method for replacing the optical drive in a PS4 Slim is &amp;quot;just take the whole god damn console apart.&amp;quot; That quarter inch of thickness saved over the standard model comes at the expense of modularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/ps4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taking the thing apart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also replaced the spinning 500GB hard drive with a 1TB SSD, which was no big deal — there&#39;s a sled that can be loosened with a single screw and any SATA laptop drive can be plugged right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall... significantly harder than upgrading a PC. But now we have a working PS4 and have been diving into &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; (him) and &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; (me), all for about $50 and some stressful tiny screw replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-ryuichi-sakamoto/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems so recently that YMO’s Yukihiro Takahashi passed, and now we lose another of the great trio, and probably the one who is most well-known internationally outside of the group. Ryuichi Sakamoto was not only the heartthrob of the band, he had an extremely prolific solo output (his most recent release came out in January), collaborated with rad people like David Sylvian, Fennesz, Alva Noto, and Iggy Pop, and has even won an Oscar for scoring &lt;em&gt;The Last Emperor&lt;/em&gt; (and probably deserved another for &lt;em&gt;The Revenant&lt;/em&gt; but was ruled ineligible for dumb reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/ryuichi-sakamoto-shape-of-music-remembrance&quot;&gt;“Music Sounds the Way it Does Because of Ryuichi Sakamoto”&lt;/a&gt;, is a great read but if you don&#39;t feel like taking the time, just trust the title. The man lived in the future but was grounded in organic and acoustic sounds, especially the piano. He will be monumentally missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is his beautiful collab with David Sylvian, “World Citizen (I Won’t Be Disappointed).”&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nerds, creatives, and knowledge workers in general seem to gravitate toward productivity schemes and methodologies. If you&#39;re anything like me, and I know some of you are because that&#39;s part of why we get along, you might jump from thing to thing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first &amp;quot;named&amp;quot; systems I can remember getting into is Getting Things Done, probably through early tech blogger Merlin Mann (now perhaps more well-known as co-host of a podcast with a guy who later became &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/bean-dad&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Bean Dad&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;). The system worked well for me for a while when I worked from home, freelanced, and had no kids. What Mann and others who jumped on the train might not have really grasped is that David Allen (not &lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sherman-hemsley-prog-rock/&quot;&gt;the guy from Gong&lt;/a&gt;) designed it for executives with assistants and both the time and power to lock themselves away for effectively days at a time while they did weekly reviews. The book came with a door hanger. Imagine your kid respecting a door hanger that says &amp;quot;Weekly review in progress.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&#39;ve been working with two systems that are more geared toward creative minds: the bullet journal and the second brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend turned me on to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;bujo&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; after I asked about the notebook she carried everywhere. The thing that its creator, Ryder Carroll, says about it is that it&#39;s a &amp;quot;mindfulness practice masquerading as a productivity method,&amp;quot; and that&#39;s very true. Sitting down with a paper notebook and doing both your todos and your actual journaling is a great way to focus, be present, and stop farting around with the external for a minute. It&#39;s also great for people with focus issues or who have trouble sticking to systems, because you can just pick it back up if you flop for a while. Start journaling again where you left off. No biggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have years of notebooks stacked up and one thing they&#39;re not good at is indexing and re-accessing information and insights that you&#39;ve achieved. This is where Tiago Forte&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Building a Second Brain&lt;/em&gt; comes into play. The core thinking behind his system is almost the opposite of the bullet journal: It&#39;s only digital tools that can store and search in a way that enables us to truly offload a lot of data from our &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes a lot of sense, of course, and it&#39;s what tools like Evernote, Joplin, Roam, whatever were originally designed for — but it also brings me back home to a reason that GTD worked for me: David Allen&#39;s core slogan was &amp;quot;If it&#39;s on your mind, it&#39;s not getting done.&amp;quot; The second brain philosophy extends that to statements like &amp;quot;it&#39;s not able to be accessed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;it&#39;s not creative fodder,&amp;quot; or more generally, &amp;quot;if it&#39;s on your mind, it&#39;s not doing you any good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot more I love about the method but that&#39;s another post. But I still feel like I owe a lot to David Allen and his insane flowcharts designed to take things &amp;quot;off your mind&amp;quot; and turn you into a robot that always knows what to do. in this stupid-ass world where we have strayed pretty far from whatever-you-believe-in&#39;s light, it&#39;s a gift to be able to stop worrying about stuff for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t even know what that means. I think things have gotten over-complicated, but the idea that I can write on my computer and publish using a git commit is pretty cool. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now thanks to Netlify. The barrier to posting was &amp;quot;Do I want to do a merge with SFTP&amp;quot; and the answer is very often &amp;quot;nah.&amp;quot; This is cooler, plus I can do it from multiple computers if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Building a useful homelab</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I started getting nervous about hosted services. Google starting to limit storage, Amazon killing off their music hosting, all of these were catalysts but a desire for privacy and a kind of old-school internet experience also drove my plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some semi-successful experimentation with Plex on a Raspberry Pi, I started thinking about how the same priciple could be applied to other services, like photo galleries. Turns out that not only are there a ton of self-hosted, open-source options for doing a lot of things you might want to do, most of them have been containerized to run in Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-components&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The components &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#the-components&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-computer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;A computer &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#a-computer&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My machine is not that powerful. It&#39;s a 4-core Pentium Lenovo Thinkstation with its main drive replaced with an SSD. It previously ran Mint desktop as a basic home computer. But after I got an old Macbook I didn&#39;t really need it, so it seemed like a perfect box to repurpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;openmediavault&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;openmediavault &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#openmediavault&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far and away the most popular operating system for these kinds of boxes is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openmediavault.org/&quot;&gt;openmediavault&lt;/a&gt;, a Debian distro with no desktop but a convenient web interface that allows even a relative dumbo like myself to mount drives and share them with services like SMB or FTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;portainer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Portainer &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#portainer&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, the web UI of OMV makes one want to do everything via your browser. SSH is not super hard, but it&#39;s mighty convenient to use Portainer, a great web UI for Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jellyfin&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Jellyfin &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#jellyfin&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending what I consider to be too much money to watch my own stuff (PlexPass at $5/month), I went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jellyfin.org/&quot;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source fork of Emby. I tell you what, we&#39;ve come a long way since the old XBMC running on an overheating computer attached directly to the TV. It has clients for our computers, iOS and Android devices, and Roku, and perhaps because it doesn&#39;t need to do transcoding for those devices, the old computer barely even has to work when streaming to two different devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;navidrome&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Navidrome &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#navidrome&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music was never a strong point of Plex, though it was capable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://navidrome.org/&quot;&gt;Navidrome&lt;/a&gt; implements the Subsonic API, which is pretty well supported in a range of (admittedly varying-quality) third party apps, though it&#39;s better than Subsonic itself, which is Java. Is it your personal Spotify? Not quite, but close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cups&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CUPS &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#cups&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, right? We have a laser printer with no built-in network capabilities, and frankly we&#39;ve had better luck using this old box than a dedicated print server from Monoprice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;paperless-ngx&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Paperless-ngx &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#paperless-ngx&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great &lt;a href=&quot;https://paperless-ngx.com/&quot;&gt;document archive system&lt;/a&gt; that lets you specify all kinds of great metadata for finding your stuff when you need it (say, tax time or when the insurance company asks for documentation). An iOS app scans directly into it, where the server then OCRs all documents. From there, machine learning tools start trying to automatically apply metadata based on your defined patterns of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;duplicati&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Duplicati &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#duplicati&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a GUI backup tool. Easy cheesy, and now all my stuff is backed up in Backblaze B2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;photos&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Photos &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#photos&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a whole other post. What a fun and frustrating journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Resources &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/building-a-useful-homelab/#resources&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to overstate the usefulness of &lt;strong&gt;/r/selfhosted&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the subreddits for all the individual tools. Lots of people of varying levels of expertise willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions on how I did some of this stuff, hit me on twitter/cohost/FB/whatever and I can try to explain it in my just-enough-to-be-dangerous way.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are these the only posts I write anymore? Talk about a legend right here, Burt Bacharach shuffled off at 94. I have to say that&#39;s a good run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, along with Hal David turned complex, jazz-derived chords and combinations into sublime, accessible pop. He collaborated with Elvis Costello and of course Dionne Warwick, among others, and inspired not just easy-listening mellow cats, but a huge range of artists that included Arthur Lee and his proto-punk band Love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true titan of music. Rest well and thanks for the music.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>RIP Yukihiro Takahashi</title>

		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-yukihiro-takahashi/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one is a little late. But here&#39;s a guy who was the vocalist and drummer of the legendary Yellow Magic Orchestra, and then — like his other two bandmates — went on to an almost equally-legendary solo discography. Like Bowie, Peter Gabriel, and Robert Fripp, Takahashi is a big inspiration on everything I do that involves &amp;quot;songs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;musicality.&amp;quot; He never strayed away from pop or accessibility, but always kept it a little left-of-center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an insanely 80s video for the title track of my favorite of his, &lt;em&gt;Murdered By The Music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In praise of Jellyfin (so far)</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-jellyfin-so-far/"/>
		<updated>2023-01-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-jellyfin-so-far/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been doing more fighting with Plex (slogan: &amp;quot;Pay $5 a month to use your own server&amp;quot;) and my Raspberry Pi-based media server than actually watching or listening anything, so I tried a few new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I repurposed a desktop that I hadn&#39;t been using since getting a 2015 Macbook that was just a place to randomly try new distros and desktop environments for no reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I put Openmediavault (the OS) on it, and slapped a Dockerized Jellyfin in there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added Tailscale to the equation so I could get there from the other end of the house (don&#39;t ask, our house is bad at internet) or from outside the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Tailscale doesn&#39;t let Roku type devices get on my tunnel, so maybe I&#39;ll use the old Pi for some kind of perma-VPN or reverse proxy or some shit I clearly do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;ve found Jellyfin to be more bare-bones yet also much more performant, more likely to direct stream than attempt to transcode, and really a breeze to work with. If you&#39;ve ever wondered about switching from Plex, it might be for you. If you are wondering about Emby, don&#39;t — Jellyfin is an open-sourced fork that is more up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Music I liked in 2022</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/music-i-liked-in-2022/"/>
		<updated>2023-01-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/music-i-liked-in-2022/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always do this, but honestly it was not a huge year for me in terms of listening to new music. I&#39;m still jamming Necrot&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Mortal&lt;/em&gt; (2020) on the regular and couldn&#39;t tell you much about what new death metal is out there. And two of my favorite bands were cut down by tragedy: Low due to Mimi Parker&#39;s untimely death from cancer, and Neurosis from the revelation that Scott Kelly was an abusive sociopath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sky Pig - &lt;em&gt;It Thrives In Darkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petbrick - &lt;em&gt;Liminal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blut Aus Nord - &lt;em&gt;Disharmonium - Undreamable Abysses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lykotonon - &lt;em&gt;Promethean Pathology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hissing - &lt;em&gt;Hypervirulence Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ADULT. - &lt;em&gt;Becoming Undone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nik Colk Void - &lt;em&gt;Bucked up Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wet Leg - &lt;em&gt;Wet Leg&lt;/em&gt; (I&#39;m still hip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jóhann Jóhannsson - &lt;em&gt;Drone Mass&lt;/em&gt; (this is mostly here because it exists. It&#39;s a gift to have more Jóhann after his death)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locrian - &lt;em&gt;New Catastrophism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vermin Womb - &lt;em&gt;Retaliation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primitive Man - &lt;em&gt;Insurmountable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undeath - &lt;em&gt;It&#39;s Time... To Rise From The Grave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hällas - &lt;em&gt;Isle of WIsdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEN Mode - &lt;em&gt;NULL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjurer - &lt;em&gt;Pathos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crowbar - &lt;em&gt;Zero and Below&lt;/em&gt; (It&#39;s Crowbar... come on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orthodox - &lt;em&gt;Proceed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanum - &lt;em&gt;Legend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was in no particular order, but I think the top spot is occupied by Haunted Horses&#39; &lt;em&gt;The Worst Has Finally Happened&lt;/em&gt;. Monstrous and unique. It does the things I like. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Real ones we lost in 2022</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/deaths-in-2022/"/>
		<updated>2023-01-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/deaths-in-2022/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If the memes and jokes are to be believed, 2022 wasn&#39;t any more of a picnic than any year since the pandemic started. Or since 2015 maybe. Or the century. Or eternity maybe. But truly, we did lose some real ones in the music world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t heard of any of these folks, I suggest you check them out. There&#39;s a lot of great art here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terry Hall.&lt;/strong&gt; The last one of the year to go that I noticed, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-terry-hall/&quot;&gt;Specials singer&lt;/a&gt; was a big loss to my musical history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Levine.&lt;/strong&gt; I was a little late to PiL, but so many of the guitarists I admire, like Daniel Ash, owe a ton to him. His work on &lt;em&gt;Metal Box&lt;/em&gt; still blows me away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.H. Peligro.&lt;/strong&gt; An incredible drummer for one of the greats in hardcore, and one of the few and the proud who proved that punk wasn&#39;t just white guys and Bad Brains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry Lee Lewis.&lt;/strong&gt; What can you say about the Killer that hasn&#39;t been said? Not the original wild man of rock and roll, but an early trash fire who paved the way for many more. Still energizing to listen to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pharaoh Sanders.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the few jazz guys I really get into. Truly expanding stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andy Fletcher.&lt;/strong&gt; Depeche Mode was an early expansion into electronic music for me, and probably half the known universe too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Lanegan.&lt;/strong&gt; One of those guys who seemed to court death for a long time before they finally hooked up. A great lyricist and so unsung in the world of Seattle music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rachel Nagy.&lt;/strong&gt; I think I only saw the Detroit Cobras once when I lived there, but they were legendary. Too young, and I still haven&#39;t heard what happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vangelis.&lt;/strong&gt; I was never a huge fan, but it&#39;s safe to say in hindsight he&#39;s one of the people who introduced me to electronic music. Maybe Jarre had more influence on me, but only because he came later — and because Vangelis&#39;s &amp;quot;Chariots of Fire&amp;quot; was so omnipresent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamont Dozier, Dennis Waterman, Ken WIlliams.&lt;/strong&gt; You might not know these names. Look them up. That&#39;s a lot of firepower lost. These are guys with both art and craft, guys whose results are very difficult to argue with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Klaus Schulze.&lt;/strong&gt; Up until relatively recently, I knew him mostly from the first Tangerine Dream album and Ash Ra Tempel, but even that&#39;d be enough to cement him in my mind as one of the greats. But then there&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Timewind,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Angst,&lt;/em&gt; and a billion other releases. A master.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big hoedown in the sky.&lt;/strong&gt; Country was hit hard in &#39;22. C.W. McCall might&#39;ve been a one-hit wonder (&amp;quot;Convoy&amp;quot;) but it was a monster and it always makes me think of my uncle who knew every word and maybe still does. Then Mickey Gilly, Naomi Judd, and Loretta Lynn? All pioneers and legends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classic rock radio.&lt;/strong&gt; Dan McCafferty of Nazareth, Wilko Johnson of Dr. Feelgood, Christine McVee, Meat Loaf. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m necessarily a fan of any of them, but their stature was undeniable. And of course, there&#39;s Meat&#39;s masterful performance in &lt;em&gt;Fight Club.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coolio.&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s fucking Coolio. How is Coolio gone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taylor Hawkins.&lt;/strong&gt; The Foos are not one of my favorites either, but it sure seems to me that he was loved by pretty much everyone who came across him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lords of the synth.&lt;/strong&gt; This year we lost both John Appleton, the inventor of the Synclavier, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-dave-smith/&quot;&gt;Dave Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the man behind Sequential Circuits and one half of the pair responsible for MIDI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronnie Spector.&lt;/strong&gt; Between her and Lamont Dozier both leaving the building, a massive chunk of Motown is gone. No disrespect to Diana Ross but Ronnie was always my favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angelo Badalamenti and Julee Cruise.&lt;/strong&gt; This is some serious garmonbozia. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/angelo/&quot;&gt;Angelo&lt;/a&gt; had a good run at least, but I was hoping to hear more from him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mimi Parker.&lt;/strong&gt; Saved the hardest for last. I truly don&#39;t know what to say about this one. So here&#39;s a video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&#39;ve been posting a lot of these RIP things lately. The Specials were, in hindsight a big deal for me. Ska was a sound that was punk-approved. And other than hip-hop, it was the first music I got into on my own that wasn&#39;t &amp;quot;loud guitar music.&amp;quot; That certainly opened up the way for so many of the things I love, from James Brown to Autechre. Arguably the only band &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; important for my branching-out was Joy Division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can&#39;t get enough of watching them play in their heyday. They looked impossibly cool, a wild mass of energy and high pants cuffs. And there was Terry Hall at the center, totally serious and almost menacing while chaos erupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy had a terrible life story with great pain in his childhood, but he translated that into a great thoughtfulness and empathy for the less fortunate in the Thatcher era. It was through him that the great contrast of the Specials — fun Jamaican-inspired music with black-humor or straight-up dark punk lyrics — manifested, and without him they&#39;ve been only half of their glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a classic Special song, here&#39;s the video for &amp;quot;Our Lips Are Sealed,&amp;quot; which Hall cowrote, and in which he looks like Robert Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, Lite XL happened this year and it&#39;s been great on Linux but is a little janky on Mac. So I&#39;ve stuck with what I know, which is the electron-based Atom by Github. Imagine my surprise when I went to make a couple CSS tweaks to this site today and found that Atom will be sunset... tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am with VSCodium, the MS-telemetry-free version of their VS Code. I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to try something that isn&#39;t electron (even though a text editor for web projects might be the most logical use of the technology), but I need to get some requisite Python tools to make CudaText work and the list is actually pretty short these days. Seems that if you have the money for Sublime you&#39;re using it, and if you don&#39;t you&#39;re on VS Code. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First Julee Cruise, now Angelo Badalamenti. One was estranged, one was presumably still a close friend. But either way, the David Lynch musical universe is a silent place now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the maestro talking about building perhaps his most iconic piece, &lt;em&gt;Laura Palmer&#39;s Theme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In Praise and Defense of the Novation Circuits</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/"/>
		<updated>2022-12-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pretty regularly on the Novation Circuit subreddit, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/novationcircuit/comments/zhzbmc/next_hardware_steps_from_tracks_rhythm/&quot;&gt;question like this&lt;/a&gt; or a comment expressing the same general idea appears. I&#39;m not familiar with any other music gear subs where the users are so often actively trying to get away from their chosen devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Circuit OG/Tracks/Rhythm are very interesting devices. Novation took the success of the Launchpad, an Ableton clip launch controller, and expanded it into a standalone device that really isn&#39;t like anything else. There&#39;s no screen. The pad grid serves as the user feedback for every function: step sequencing, keyboard, pattern launching, mixing, even the tempo display. That makes it a device that sometimes needs a great deal of memorizing (or RTFM, initially). But it also makes it a device that absolutely nails what it means to be &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tactile&lt;/em&gt; — attributes that screen-poisoned musicians supposedly crave these days when they step away from the DAW. There&#39;s no clicking, no menu diving, no using a scroll wheel to name a pattern. There&#39;s you, there&#39;s the buttons and knobs, and there&#39;s the music. And trust me, it&#39;s extremely quick to get to the &amp;quot;music&amp;quot; step. Features of both current-gen Circuits include one-button &amp;quot;scene&amp;quot; launching, sequencer probability and random mutation, pattern chaining for very long variations, and really usable reverb and delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does everyone think they need to &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; to an Elektron machine, an MPC, or god forbid a Roland MC-707?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheap&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Cheap... &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/#cheap&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, these things are not expensive. About $350 gets you a new one, and for better or worse this &amp;quot;gotta upgrade&amp;quot; attitude leaves Reverb stocked with them for much less. I think there&#39;s an attitude with all kinds of musicians that the more you spend, the better your stuff is. Surprise! That&#39;s bullshit. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m that old blues lawyer guitarist insisting that &amp;quot;tone is in the fingers&amp;quot; — after all, these same people are connecting 1958 Les Pauls to Dumble amps via Monster cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean is electronic musical instruments are very rarely apples-to-apples comparisons. They all have their strengths and their frustrations. And good stuff has never been cheaper than it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-unspecialized&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;And unspecialized... &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/#and-unspecialized&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that, possibly because of said price, no pros have decided that these things have a certain space. If you want to make hard techno or dancey industrial, people like NIN and Richard Devine have sold you on Elektron machines and their hyped, exciter-pumped sounds. If you make lo-fi or boom bap, you want an SP-404 because Madlib, J Dilla, Flying Lotus, and who knows who else used one to make their iconic material. Even doofy gear gets this treatment at times, like the really uninspiring Microkorg being anointed the &amp;quot;synth for an indie rock band that has a synth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Circuit&#39;s space? It doesn&#39;t have one. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a &amp;quot;master of none&amp;quot; because it&#39;s quite good at plenty of things, but looking at it you don&#39;t say &amp;quot;ah yes, this thing is for X.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe id=&quot;reddit-embed&quot; src=&quot;https://www.redditmedia.com/r/novationcircuit/comments/vgvqt2/first_composition_with_both_tracks_and_rhythm/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share&amp;amp;embed=true&amp;amp;theme=dark&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-like-me&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Just like me. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/#just-like-me&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can say about the Circuits, especially the Circuit Tracks, is that they are now my centerpiece for both performing and composing, and in 20+ years of making live electronic music I have not owned another machine that enabled my way of working so thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I like more precise sample cutting onboard? Yeah probably. What about separate outputs? Always want those. But &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; features like these imply that the very purposeful design of these devices somehow includes more mistakes than it actually does. And the sum of the features versus tradeoffs is unlike anything else out there for both utility and (&lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;) fun. So I&#39;m not sure that an upgrade would actually be one at all.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Partially because there have been vast swathes of my life that went un-gamed, and partially because I have only kept a nintendo console around for quite a few years now, I tend to get into games late. My latest to finally add to the pile was &lt;em&gt;The Witcher III: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;, the main storyline of which I finished today, probably prematurely due to a week of being sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;openness&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Openness &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#openness&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit it&#39;s a lot of game. And unlike Skyrim, you can go just about anywhere. Nobody climbs like Link, but Geralt does a good job of getting around territory. At least until he dies of falling from any height greater than 6 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;combat&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Combat &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#combat&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most 3d action RPGs, you can either parry or dodge-and-roll your way through combat. And as with all the rest, I take the latter path (arguably blocking is better since a perfect parry almost always gets you a nice opening — probably just one of the many reasons I&#39;m shit at &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt;). But either way the combat is a lot of fun. Much like Link&#39;s runes or a weapon/destruction hybrid build in Skyrim, the weapon and magic combo is really satisfying and gives combat a lot of variety. Geralt is a little slower to act than say, Link, but you get his timing down and you feel unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-mechanics-to-tell-the-story&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Using mechanics to tell the story &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#using-mechanics-to-tell-the-story&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really think one the bar to hit here is &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;, but W3 does a great job sporadically. Playing as Ciri in flashback (or her supremely overpowered moment near the end, one-hitting wild hunt warriors) is a fun mix-up that lets you &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; the story a bit more. With a few exceptions, I have very little idea what the dialog options did to my playthrough and that&#39;s kinda cool. I guess it&#39;s a choice-mechanic equivalent of the open world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bummers&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Bummers &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#bummers&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, something about the linear story that&#39;s very cleverly woven into an open-world game left me feeling &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; when it resolved. And I know there&#39;s a lot more there I haven&#39;t done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load times are really unfortunate, at least on the Switch. In story-heavy sections, there&#39;s a lot of it. Fast travel feels not all that fast when you can sometimes ride your horse there faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame rate is not great. &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt; is a newer game that feels really intensive, but it rarely got herky-jerky. When it rains in a busy place like Novigrad (which is often), Geralt starts doing the robot. Weirder and more distracting is the crappy framerate in some cut scenes. In a game with so many of them, it&#39;s unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this impeding me enjoying the shit out of it. Even the fall damage thing, because I laughed my ass off every time Geralt died by tripping over a rock.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Is this really it?</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/is-this-really-it/"/>
		<updated>2022-10-27T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The number of occasions I&#39;ve heard masses of people say they&#39;re going to walk away from Twitter now numbers in the dozens over the years. The company has demonstrated contempt for the users that can be rivaled only by Meta, having pivoted many years ago from adding features based on usage (&lt;em&gt;Retweets&lt;/em&gt;) to generally delivering weird non-features that even the advertisers don&#39;t really want (&lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now it&#39;s being bought by a guy who has latched onto the &amp;quot;free speech brigade&amp;quot; not because he&#39;s particularly pro-free-speech (he&#39;s not), or because his politics align with those kinds of people (they do), but because he seems dumb enough to believe their spiel (he might be). A union-buster, an apartheid-profiter, and a guy who has used the platform that will soon be his to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get yelled at by a Wachowski&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libel the guy who saved that Thai sports team after nobody liked his coffin submarine idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict the end of COVID-19 with the accuracy of Nate Silver picking numbers out of a hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally sound like a dumbass who&#39;d be cringey and goofy if he wasn&#39;t so simultaneously powerful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Doesn&#39;t bode all that well. Maybe it&#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Cohost? I dunno. Probably another thing that&#39;ll come and go quickly. I still get spam emails from Ello, the supposed Facebook-killer that was all in black-and-white Courier font and whose name I had to look up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how to Mastodon despite being acquainted with its founder and signing up for many servers over the years. Somehow the email model of &amp;quot;different servers but everyone can talk&amp;quot; fails to make sense to me in a social media context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I use Twitter less and less every year, and these days even the months show decline. And maybe it&#39;s time for us all to stop trying to post through it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>One year with Obsidian</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/one-year-with-obsidian/"/>
		<updated>2022-08-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/one-year-with-obsidian/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-better-way-to-keep-notes/&quot;&gt;post about trying Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; about a year ago. In that time, I have not really strayed from it, which is pretty unusual for me. I get really restless with tools. Thanks to a very active plugin community, theme ecosystem, and subreddit, it&#39;s become a great tool that is super customizable. I adapted a few times and that was no biggie at all thanks to the fact that Obsidian is based entirely around discrete files, stored in your file system, with their own regular ol&#39; file names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current way of operating is shamefully trendy; I&#39;m using Tiago Forte&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Building a Second Brain&lt;/em&gt; as the methodology. One reason is that it works reasonably well with other tools including paper journaling and &lt;a href=&quot;https://raindrop.io/&quot;&gt;Raindrop&lt;/a&gt; bookmarks. Though he apparently uses Evernote and swears by its search (which is still quite good despite Evernote&#39;s many problems), I think the linking features in Obsidian are really what makes it good for this system. Knowledge doesn&#39;t just go in a filing cabinet and get dusty. You can always see it thanks to links and unlinked mentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still not interested in changing, and as long as I am still locked into the old $5 rate for syncing, I will keep that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When moving site hosts to save a buck I seem to have screwed some things up. I&#39;m not interested in paying for a new Kirby license so I&#39;m trying a static site generator (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, as much as I was able to do some bulk text conversion, I&#39;m just not an expert at that stuff. For everything I love about Kirby, it unfortunately does not store all the page data in frontmatter like almost every other CMS or site generator. So it&#39;s been a bit of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot: even compared to Kirby or Grav or whatever, this thing should be &lt;em&gt;fast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relocate older posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recreate the old listing page (maybe?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt;Get rid of &amp;quot;/blog/&amp;quot; as the first link in the listing&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>RIP Dave Smith</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-dave-smith/"/>
		<updated>2022-06-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-dave-smith/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Less than 3 weeks after making an appearance at Superbooth and looking healthy and enthusiastic, Dave Smith is dead at 72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t know who he is, Smith is a synth pioneer who founded Sequential Circuits in the 70s. They made a lot of iconic synths but were most famous for the Prophet 5, pretty much the first programmable polyphonic synth. It really has yet to be topped, which is probably why the re-built company is still making a Prophet 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in the early 80s he conceived of and developed a universal interface for synthesizers from different manufacturers to talk to each other. Whether the fact that it&#39;s still in use today is evidence of its effectiveness or of how out-of-date it is now, you can&#39;t argue that MIDI is one of the most important things to happen in the world of music since the development of the synthesizer itself. He and Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi (also sadly no longer with us) even received a Grammy for the development of MIDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who might never afford a Prophet, MIDI is the great unifier. Since its inception, it has allowed the fanciest Oberheim, the lowliest Volca, your SP-404 loaded with samples of farts, whatever it is, to talk to each other. The standard even continues into the computer, where I can download MIDI files of Clyde Stubblefield playing drums and replace all the hits with sounds of dogs barking or car crashes. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s exactly what Smith had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of that, one of Smith&#39;s other ventures was the first real software synth, Reality. Though he didn&#39;t ultimately care for making music inside a computer, it&#39;s another project he spearheaded that pretty much changed music forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only thing left to say is thanks. You&#39;ll be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Yes, Virginia, there is a Microsoft version of that</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/yes-virginia-there-is-a-microsoft-version-of-that/"/>

		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/yes-virginia-there-is-a-microsoft-version-of-that/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It can be tough when you&#39;re stuck in Windows world, with security lockdowns on your computer and a ban on most cloud services. With the notable exceptions of UserZoom, Figma, and Overflow, I&#39;m in MS world and that&#39;s been an adjustment after the world of Google Apps and other lightweight, web-based tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a benefit to being entirely in Microsoftland, or at least in theory there is. Kinda looks like with the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop?ms.url=microsoftcommicrosoft-loop&quot;&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt; they are trying to make good on that theory and put it into real practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to say that Loop is a Notion ripoff seems partially true. But for those of us stuck here in Office 365 with no hope of using the real thing, that&#39;s totally &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. Just like Planner is not Trello and Todo isn&#39;t quite what Wunderlist was, and Power Automate is far from being as easy to work as IFTTT or Zapier — but they exist. I can imagine a lightweight database table like what Notion employs would be so much easier for many of the small tasks where I&#39;m using SharePoint Lists. But the &amp;quot;components&amp;quot; feature of Loop seems to be where MS are really trying to take it a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind components seems to be that the pieces of functionality (like Notion blocks?) are available elsewhere in the Office ecosystem: Teams chats, Word docs, email messages. And that&#39;s the kind of interoperability that we really don&#39;t enjoy today, even though that should be a prime selling point of Microsoftland. Mail Merge isn&#39;t exactly the future. But maybe Loop will be?&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lite-xl.com/&quot;&gt;contradictory name&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t necessarily want to get on the Electron hate train, but when you see the speed at which this thing fires up (much faster than VSCode, faster than GEdit, even) you might consider ditching Atom.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My quest for simplicity has led to some people doing some pretty interesting stuff. Even more appealing to me than Utopia is &lt;a href=&quot;https://every-layout.dev/&quot;&gt;Every Layout&lt;/a&gt;, which frankly seems hard to sum up in an elevator pitch, but like Utopia it aims to get CSS back to declaration and away from prescription. In this case, it seems largely because declarative just &lt;em&gt;works better&lt;/em&gt;. My only beef with this thing is the price. It&#39;s no doubt that a lot of work went into it but 70 bucks is steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further I read into the sample content, the more I&#39;m standing up, punching the air, screaming. It&#39;s that invigorating and it makes that much sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, one of the authors is responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cube.fyi/&quot;&gt;CUBE CSS&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;m been looking at with interest too. I&#39;m a BEM-head from way back, but this looks like an interesting philosophical take on CSS that embraces a recent trend among true HTML/CSS folks: &lt;strong&gt;Stop fighting the cascade.&lt;/strong&gt; You&#39;re speaking my language.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Another day, another blog redesign</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/another-day-another-blog-redesign/"/>
		<updated>2022-04-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/another-day-another-blog-redesign/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Been thinking about doing this ever since I did the last one. It never quite came out the way I wanted and frankly, the newspaper-ish feel just didn&#39;t work. It worked in my head, and it sorta-kinda worked in Figma, and it just didn&#39;t translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading about Utopia and thinking, hey maybe I should do that, I went a little deeper into the rabbit hole of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was no Figma phase to the &amp;quot;design.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did this entirely live by mounting my website with &lt;code&gt;rclone&lt;/code&gt; and editing live with GEdit (Atom couldn&#39;t browse and edit the remote files fast enough).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 157 lines of CSS, un-minified, with a carriage return between each rule. It uses &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; media queries. There aren&#39;t even any columns, so I didn&#39;t get the chance to evolve from flexbox to grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m using CSS custom properties for the second time in my life, and though it doesn&#39;t give me everything I want from the Sass feature set, it&#39;s really great to get variables while staying native.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&#39;t quite leave the HTML unchanged, but I probably could&#39;ve. I&#39;ve been using almost the same HTML pretty much since I switched to Kirby many years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard posts have a larger first paragraph. This might possibly be inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/&quot;&gt;Lagrange&lt;/a&gt;, the nicest Gemini client out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&#39;ll enjoy looking at this for a couple weeks and then off we go again, probably with a pendulum swing to complexity. Or maybe I&#39;ll just change that yellow to something else to tide me over for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Utopian thinking</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/utopian-thinking/"/>
		<updated>2022-04-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/utopian-thinking/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://utopia.fyi/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously we&#39;ve gotten pretty far away from the fundamentals of the web. &amp;quot;Text with hyperlinks&amp;quot; is the mission of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gemini.circumlunar.space/&quot;&gt;Gemini project&lt;/a&gt;, something that&#39;s described as heavier than Gopher and lighter than the web. So there&#39;s an appetite for those simpler days. All the myriad ways we&#39;ve strayed from Hypertext&#39;s light would take quite a few more blog posts and sound like an old man yelling at clouds, but in terms of web design it feels pretty specific. Build tools. Compiled code. Scoping and renaming classes at runtime. Arguments about whether to put CSS in JS. Not gonna belabor that, you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught myself to ditch tables around 2002-2003 by reading Eric Meyer&#39;s O&#39;Reilly title &lt;em&gt;CSS: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt;, which is purely a reference title. It was not what I would call complicated. It probably took me just as long to figure out how to implement Grunt, which was already supplanted by Gulp by that time. Life is complicated, and I guess life in CSS has gotten that way as well. It feels such a long way from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csszengarden.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t necessarily think that breakpoints and media queries are an extreme example of the complication — remember conditional comments? Remember writing separate sites from Netscape and Internet Explorer? But I do think Utopia&#39;s authors asserting that their framework is &amp;quot;declarative&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;prescriptive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;instructive&amp;quot; brings it back to the fundamentals of CSS. I find it a bit ironic though that they&#39;re using some really complicated calculations to achieve simplicity for the user. I recognize that bootstrap does something similar when calculating the grid, but the deeper the math I don&#39;t understand burrows, the more scared I am of relying on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t read enough of the material here to understand how they handle anything other than the spacing and typography — and whether they like it or not, there is more to it than that, even if those are the only two things you &lt;em&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; take away. Looks like it may be relying on CSS grids to keep things in one media space. And lord knows I haven&#39;t adequately learned CSS grids yet. But I&#39;m going to give this a shot. Maybe the next version of this site will be Utopian.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pentagram does a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/pentagram-the-fbi-guide-to-internet-slang-graphic-design-100322&quot;&gt;snarky thing with a fun type design&lt;/a&gt;. Like Bierut, I wonder if any of these terms the FBI notes have ever been used by &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. The idea of the document reminds me of the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/LawEnforcementGuideToSatanicCults1994VHSOccultHilarity&quot;&gt;Law Enforcement Guide to Satanic Cults&lt;/a&gt;. Link is to the film but its print predecessor baffled me even in middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It speaks to the (uh, problematic) law enforcement mindset that there are dark forces and coded evils working in all corners of the world and they&#39;re the last bastion of defense against it. Too often those &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; symbols are just non-WASP identifiers, and fear of youth comes from the same place — especially when so much of internet slang comes from AAVE and other non-white sources.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eric Meyer on the CSS Working Group&#39;s attempts to add conditionals to CSS. My most recent side project uses pure CSS with variables, which is a huge step toward me not caring about preprocessors anymore. With logic, the only things left are concatenation (probably solved already), and nesting syntax, which I find cleaner to go through later on. He&#39;s right though, as a Sass user I can easily see both sides of this argument and don&#39;t know what&#39;s right. But I know it&#39;s progress, and in my current way of thinking, more features in CSS is better. Because no matter how &amp;quot;bloated&amp;quot; you think it&#39;ll be, it&#39;s still better than having to use extra tools that aren&#39;t natively parsed by the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framer.com/sites/&quot;&gt;Framer Sites&lt;/a&gt; looks wild. Framer already generates pretty good HTML, and this seems to represent the final few pieces necessary to actually turn that into a functional website. And CMS features are coming soon? Finally someone&#39;s really coming for the king in a big way, for the first time since the king has been Figma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this finally The Thing we&#39;ve been looking for? A design tool that builds websites visually, but in a real &amp;quot;web-like&amp;quot; way? That&#39;s been an unsatisfactory process since my first job using NetObjects Fusion (which apparently is better in itself these days, using CSS grid instead of the absolute positioning it employed almost 25 years ago). Frankly, potentially exciting, although these days — as in those days — it&#39;s fun to whip up some HTML to create a nice looking site. Still feels like alchemy to me.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I salute you, MMT-8</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/i-salute-you-mmt-8/"/>
		<updated>2022-03-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/i-salute-you-mmt-8/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Few pieces of gear are, on their own, really inspiring. Even the worst gear has its merits, but even the best sounding stuff isn&#39;t enough to be a wellspring of creativity. Ableton Live comes to mind, as well as the truly unique Novation Circuit, a cheap groovebox with no screen that I love almost as much as a family pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been digging an old school piece of hardware that probably sounds the least likely to fall into this category. The &lt;strong&gt;Alesis MMT-8&lt;/strong&gt; is technically not a sequencer, but an 8-channel MIDI &amp;quot;recorder&amp;quot; and playback machine. It really does work a lot like an 8-track tape machine, but with MIDI data instead of audio. That means that it can control up to 8 devices by either playing notes, triggering their own sequencers, sending program change, and transmitting CC data. It&#39;s become the central master of my setup, and though it has its faults, it&#39;s so refreshing to get away from the computer for real that I&#39;m itching to get on with writing new music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a strange design that could only come out of the late 80s, like Knight Rider. It shares the lazer-zap shape with its brother the HR-16 (precursor to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-the-alesis-sr-16&quot;&gt;most successful drum machine of all time&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the strange flip-up panel on top that contains an abbreviated user manual. Oddly, that shape does have the advantage of fitting a Korg Volca really nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/mmt8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alesis MMT-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &amp;quot;issue&amp;quot; with the machine is that it doesn&#39;t have a very accurate clock. It&#39;s slow by about a whole BPM. If you want to be tempo-accurate, you need something else to send the data. On its own though, it has a pretty solid clock, though it purely transmits what was recorded into it, so if you want some unique feel or timing with &amp;quot;character&amp;quot; you&#39;ll need to trigger other sequencers. I&#39;m just dreading when I play a show and someone comes up to me to say &amp;quot;I bet you thought you were playing at 74 bpm but that was really 73.&amp;quot; They&#39;re out there. I&#39;m sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one workflow issue it has is a lack of overdubbing. If, for instance, I want drums and hi hats to be on the same track, I have to play the whole mess at once. Potentially a challenge, and more or less impossible if I want some kind of CC data at the same time. So those have to go on different channels. That being said, I have yet to feel like I need more than 8 channels. And when I do, I&#39;ll probably just find another MMT for about a hundred bucks. It does have extremely detailed editing capability as long as you&#39;re willing to do it on a 2-line LCD screen with squishy rubber buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s remarkably fast and intuitive once you&#39;re in there, and that has always been the most important thing to me in a creative tool. Get me punching in notes and feeling the song, not thinking about how a thing works. And it&#39;s rare to get that along with the immediacy of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Alesis MMT-8, I salute you.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bob Moog and usability heuristics</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/bob-moog-and-usability-heuristics/"/>
		<updated>2021-08-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/bob-moog-and-usability-heuristics/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/how-bob-moog-brought-usability-heuristics-to-the-electronic-synthesizer-a6797a3a9192&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a rare intersection of my interests.&lt;/a&gt; This is actually a great article for UX folks who don&#39;t know anything about synthesizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author makes the (accurate) argument that Bob Moog changed the game by hard-wiring some signal paths and abandoning the fully customizable cable-based routing of modular synths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially what Apple did in terms of UI as well that led to their early success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preset the red routes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable other routes with some switches that are not part of the main UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just abandon the ability to do some things that most users won&#39;t need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made Apple popular with artists, designers and musicians, just as the Model D became the first synth truly popular with a wide range of musicians. Sure, the Rick Wakemans (and Linus Torvalds) of the world might want more, but they have their complicated alternatives. For the rest of us, it was finally time to make music with synths. Just watch any gear-focused interview with John Foxx, Gary Numan, George Clinton, Rick Wright, you name it — the Model D hugely influenced their worlds so they could influence the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/modeld.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Minimoog Model D&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This philosophy can still be controversial at times, as with GNOME 3 (which, incidentally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/2691192/how-gnome-3-14-is-winning-back-disillusioned-linux-users.html&quot;&gt;has become less loathed&lt;/a&gt; in the years since its release), but in general the idea of solving for the 90% of users who don&#39;t need 50% of the features is considered an obvious one nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, modulars have seen a resurgence lately because once you&#39;re in deep you inevitably want to start making your own synths. But that hasn&#39;t stopped the steady stream of simplistic analog boxes like the Volca series or Behringer&#39;s slavish old-school synth imitations. Options are great, but menu diving is no fun and the quickest way to get a musician to love your instrument is to get them creating quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this, as the article gets across pretty well, is what we should learn from Moog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple would&#39;ve patented the pitch wheel though.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-better-way-to-keep-notes/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m definitely not alone here but finding the perfect toolset is a slight neurosis of mine. And I thought I had it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/typora-for-windows&quot;&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt;, a flat, local markdown editor with a notebook view and cross-platform access. But along comes a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; — in our local Nextdoor of all places — and I feel finally ready to move things off Notion and out of the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/obs_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Obsidian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has a lot of great features on top of being a markdown notebook, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web-less encrypted sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS-based themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wiki-style internal linking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a nifty graph of all the links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mobile version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plugin architecture with a very active community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing it lacks from Notion is a database, but increasingly I find that the kitchen-sink approach isn&#39;t working for me. I just want structured text with images, and I can go to LibreOffice Base or Airtable to organize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags: tools,markdown,notes&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-05-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/figma-organization-for-busy-designers/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT TO THIS POST: &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511413-Set-custom-thumbnails-for-files&quot;&gt;Figma has a much more native way of handling this now&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s pretty rad, try it out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re like a lot of designers, especially young enthusiastic ones or possibly freelancers with time between projects, you love to organize and beautify your systems. I&#39;ve made a new CSS theme for my markdown editor! I built a home page for my browser that beautifully links to my current projects and most common pages. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big offenders in the mess of my work life is the list of Figma projects. It&#39;ll always be preferable to the classic joke of &lt;code&gt;design_final_final_r2__final.sketch&lt;/code&gt; that anyone still in pre-Figma world is probably still dealing with, but it can be rough on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with something that works well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, you &lt;strong&gt;have to give files a cover page&lt;/strong&gt;.  Just do it. Mine use a frame that is 1240px x 660px.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Figma project is actually a project category: Online banking designs, public web page designs,  internal software tools, customer journey maps, and libraries. Within those, each has its own style of cover page. This gives each listing page a unified feel and it&#39;s always obvious which list I&#39;m looking at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use the default gray background on the cover page, unless it&#39;s something I&#39;m actively working on at the moment. Then I change it to green. This gives the cover a green border around it in the listing page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/figma_home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figma&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create components for those covers in case you feel like you might want to change them down the road. Et voila, you&#39;ve really simply gone from a mess in your projects list to an organized and legible design portal.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Typora for Windows</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/typora-for-windows/"/>
		<updated>2021-05-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/typora-for-windows/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve now been on Windows at work for 3 years and finally found a notes solution that seems to work. I have a weird set of requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want it to look reasonably good if I&#39;m looking at it all day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has to support Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should support images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have a &amp;quot;notebook&amp;quot; interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can&#39;t use web sync because I work at a financial institution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&#39;t run installers (unless they&#39;re single-user) because my work machine is locked down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typora.io/&quot;&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt;. Insanely, it actually meets all these requirements, including a great notebook-style interface when you open an entire folder. Plus it has a few other features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document outline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple themes (most of which aren&#39;t super great)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export into HTML, PDF and all kinds of other formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re on Windows or Linux, give it a shot. It&#39;s on Mac OS as well, but Mac users have such a glut of great markdown editors and notebooks (Bear and Byword are still among my favorites) that I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth mentioning for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I have moved away from Typora in favor of a complete knowledgebase approach of Obsidian, which is far more of a &amp;quot;notebook.&amp;quot; Plus Typora has a cost and I can&#39;t buy stuff like this for my work machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;They said it couldn&#39;t be done — removing yourself from Amazon. In truth, it mostly can&#39;t. If you use almost any web-based service, you&#39;re using AWS. And if you&#39;re like me, stretched out across multiple different platforms, you probably use some of those. But we stopped shopping there, I got a Kobo, and we&#39;re on the way to replacing our smart speaker. Honestly? Not that hard. Prime video is about the only true difficulty, especially since they have Star Trek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, riding high on this pseudo-victory, I have declared I&#39;m going to remove Google from my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the deal, though. I&#39;ve read posts like this from people more tech-savvy and smarter than myself, and I don&#39;t think I can go that hard. It sounds... tough. I just want to stop depending on them, stop letting them see everything I do, and generally stop supporting them. There are so many reasons out there for doing so, but that&#39;s not what this is about. This is about a quest for alternatives to the company that practically wrote the book on doing stuff in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pieces&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The pieces &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/the-great-un-googling/#the-pieces&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start cataloging it, there&#39;s a lot. And some are just gonna have to slide, no doubt about it, but I&#39;ll get there eventually. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m at with alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gmail.&lt;/strong&gt; I looked at Proton, which is great if you really want to get into the extremes of privacy, and a few others, before settling on &lt;a href=&quot;http://fastmail.com/&quot;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt;. Fastmail won out for its UI, pricing to storage ratio, and inclusion of a calendar. Some friends&#39; recommendations sealed that deal. Fastmail also features alias boxes, which can send or receive mail, and those are helping me get rid of the numerous random Gmail boxes in addition to the main one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docs.&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of the day, I so rarely need a word processor and almost any will work. My personal hangup about docs is that I usually want structure rather than WYSIWYG layouts. It&#39;s a big part of why I use &lt;s&gt;Notion&lt;/s&gt; Obsidian and frankly in most cases I&#39;ll just publish a PDF out of there. I write my post drafts in there since it&#39;s Markdown. But Apple&#39;s Pages online and MS Word online are totally fine, and more recently I found the hosted version of open-source OnlyOffice. As a bonus, it&#39;s a great replacement for the aging and frustrating LibreOffice on the Linux desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheets.&lt;/strong&gt; When Google Sheets launched, it was insane. Zoho had done it, but not well, and that&#39;s about it. There are all kinds of great tools out there now that make a spreadsheet seem quaint, but sometimes you just need a spreadsheet. It&#39;s still the &amp;quot;killer app.&amp;quot; And the originator is still pretty good at it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://excel.office.com/&quot;&gt;Excel&lt;/a&gt; online is a little more computer-intensive, but it does the thing well and doesn&#39;t get into other stuff. Coda is a possibility, but the learning curve is steep, and I&#39;ve seen recommendations for Airtable but as cool as it is (I use it for a few things) it&#39;s really a different animal. OnlyOffice wins again, for anything that needs more math and fewer relationships than I would handle with Airtable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive.&lt;/strong&gt; My god, it&#39;s full of storage. There are so many alternatives out there it&#39;s not even worth it. If you want to use the same provider as your docs or sheets, then go with Microsoft or Apple. If privacy is your main value, try &lt;a href=&quot;http://pcloud.com/&quot;&gt;pCloud&lt;/a&gt; or Mega. I&#39;ve personally gone with pCloud because of its media capabilities and generous size (not to mention its charmingly rough edges and desktop Linux integration), but my eggs are well distributed among many baskets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike email, there just aren&#39;t a lot of low-cost storage options for photos. Flickr has been so fucked-with for so long since Yahoo! took over that I can&#39;t make heads or tails of where they&#39;re going with it, and most services (that aren&#39;t AMZ) are geared toward photographers, not regular folks backing up their stuff. So for now, I have nothing except redundant external drives and possibly a larger pCloud plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromebook.&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously Google tracking your entire operating system is not super ideal. However, this was easier to resolve than I expected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton&quot;&gt;Crouton&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to install a Linux environment with xfce. I&#39;m still tweaking but it&#39;s working pretty well, especially considering my Chromebook runs on a Rockchip, which I think is like an ARM?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of technology used to be this way. We used the best provider for each service or application. The idea of going to a one-stop shop is relatively new. Yeah, it makes things simple, but if the price for turning computing devices into dead-simple consumer electronics is all my privacy, I&#39;m going to try to roll my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>New device: Behringer TD-3</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/"/>
		<updated>2021-04-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s pretty safe to call Behringer &amp;quot;much-maligned.&amp;quot; Obviously they have a tendency to do the cheap imitation version of gear, and Uli seems like kind of a dick. But rather than Mackie mixers or random pedals, they&#39;ve set their sights in the past decade on the unobtanium of electronic music stuff. The Minimoog, the ARP 2600, the 808. And one of the recent ones is the Roland TB-303.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked one up on Reverb for under $100 shipped, so it&#39;s kind of hard to say no. It goes well with my other small, cheap desktop modules like the Volca series and Arturia Microbrute. It is, however, a bit flimsier feeling than the others. But I&#39;ve been assured by some owners of the original that it was also a plastic box that you wouldn&#39;t want to drop from too far up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/td3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TD-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sounds&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sounds &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/#sounds&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does it sound? There are plenty of YouTube videos at this point, but more than any other piece of synth gear I have, it does One Thing. It does that thing right, though. There are two wave shapes, the saw and square, and simplistic filter controls that were meant for guitarists rather than subtractive synth experts to work. The TB-3 adds a nice distortion option that the 303 lacked, and it really helps the bass cut through a thicker mix. I almost never turn it off, especially on the square wave shape. There&#39;s also a little patch bay at the top that lets you do some very basic CV controls. I could probably sync the filter to the kick pattern of the Volca Beats or send gate info to the Microbrute arpeggiator, but I have yet to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sequences&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sequences &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/#sequences&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that I almost wish wasn&#39;t so authentic is the sequencer. It works by programming notes, then by going back and programming all their lengths, including rests and holds. You really have to plan out your patterns in advance before starting to punch buttons. Fortunately, you can switch the thing into pitch mode and send it notes from somewhere else, like Ableton Live or my Alesis MMT-8 sequencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Summary &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/#summary&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those folks who automatically won&#39;t buy Behringer aside (I get you), the TB-3 isn&#39;t a device for everyone. It only does one thing, and chances are it&#39;ll makes you think of acid house as soon as it starts playing. But if you need bass in your setup, you could do a lot worse than around a hundred bucks for something that can shake the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Creating music during the pandemic</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/creating-music-during-the-pandemic/"/>
		<updated>2021-03-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/creating-music-during-the-pandemic/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I suppose I was fortunate, really. My band&#39;s drummer, who also wrote maybe 70% of the guitar riffs, finished his PhD and left the country to go work in Switzerland. Writing out that sentence makes me realize he was the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fortunate one. But what I mean is, a lot of my musician friends had to deal with the fact that they couldn&#39;t get together during the pandemic. For better or worse, I didn&#39;t have a band anymore to worry about.  Fortunately, prior to 2020 I&#39;d released about a dozen releases (between digital, CD and cassette) over the past 20 years that featured no other musicians but me. So I started to hit the shed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a process musician for most of that time. Each project, each release, is the result of a way of working. It comes from being in the experimental world for so long. Now, even when I make something that I find enjoyable to listen to, it&#39;s still gonna be made via a specific process. And when I make something with that process, I tend to move on. But that kind of indulgence is tough for someone with kids and a day job. Movement doesn&#39;t happen quickly enough, and output is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I came up with the plan of forcing myself into the shed once a week, and I decided I wasn&#39;t going to come out of the shed until I had a finished song.  Talking it out with a friend, I realized this accomplishes a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It opens the throttle on that speed of progress. If you just &amp;quot;play around&amp;quot; once a week for a couple hours, you&#39;re not going to get anywhere for a long time. Validating an idea once a week gets you through the ruts and the familiar patterns and into new ideas sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It keeps you from being precious about polish and &amp;quot;finish.&amp;quot; The dumb truth of a piece of music or art is that it&#39;s finished when you say it is. &lt;em&gt;Bee Thousand&lt;/em&gt; is just as &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; as &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt;, and they&#39;re both classics of their space. One was made by a group of guys with infinite time and money, and the other was made by a drunk schoolteacher with kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you go with your gut. Maybe if I hadn&#39;t been doing this for close to 25 years, I wouldn&#39;t feel like the gut was a useful thing. But the gut has become experienced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently using this process to create new Various Reasons tunes, always with the further constraint that someday they can be recreated live, but the first work I did with a &amp;quot;live band&amp;quot; style and put onto Bandcamp as Mezzo Cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&quot;border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;&quot; src=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4022765204/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mezzocortex.bandcamp.com/album/a-litany-of-bad-news&quot;&gt;A Litany of Bad News by mezzo cortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

		<title>Boring gear post (pedalboard layout</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/"/>
		<updated>2019-07-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/pedalbored.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pedalboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any mediocre guitarist, I spend a lot of time rethinking my tone and my pedalboard. Like any experimental musician who likes to turn guitars into other sounds, I spend a lot of time trying to balance versatility and ease of use. Nobody likes to tap dance one-footed, even if you can perform an entire symphony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last year, I&#39;ve really landed on a layout that I like. In order of the signal chain, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;boss-tu-2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Boss TU-2 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#boss-tu-2&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say about this. Fancy tuners come around every once in a while, but for accuracy, visibility, and durability, it&#39;s hard to beat the classic Boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pepers-pedals-rad&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Pepers Pedals RAD &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#pepers-pedals-rad&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Rat pedal. Pretty simple. It&#39;s made by Tony Pepers in New Zealand, and when you buy his pedals they come with this amazing gummy candy that&#39;s only available there. There are standard Rat controls and a switch that changes the clipping mode from standard Rat to Turbo Rat, or removes the clipping altogether. Without clipping, it&#39;s decidedly less Rat-like but it&#39;s still a very hairy fuzz. I don&#39;t stack overdrives and distortions anymore. I just crank up a Rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;morley-mini-volume&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Morley Mini Volume &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#morley-mini-volume&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the size of this thing. I always put volume pedals after the distortion, even though I sometimes can&#39;t get total silence with it rocked down, because that way the tone doesn&#39;t change when I fade it up and down. I do waffle on whether to put it in front of or behind my preamp pedal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;joyo-british-sound&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Joyo British Sound &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#joyo-british-sound&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is 100% a ripoff, possibly a stolen board design, of the Tech 21 British pedal, and it&#39;s probably unethical to buy this or any Joyo pedal because even the original designs have been more or less funded by this kind of stuff. But damn, it cost me $20 and it helps add that throaty, low-midrange roar to my plain sounding solid state amp. Plus I can dial in just the right amount of gain so that even the clean tone has a tiny bit of breakup. That helps make my cleans a little softer on the attack and less obviously solid-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;line-6-m5&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Line 6 M5 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#line-6-m5&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line 6 is not exactly the most prestigious brand to put on your board, but this pedal is ridiculously useful for keeping said board from getting completely out of hand. I use it primarily for modulation and special effects. I currently use the M5 for the pitch detune effect at the end of &amp;quot;We Are The Life of the Future,&amp;quot; and for wah/filter during &amp;quot;We Live Inside.&amp;quot; Both of these use the M-Audio expression pedal that&#39;s plugged into it (another not-great brand but it&#39;s lasted longer than the Roland one I used to have). Beyond the tremolos, choruses, flangers and other modulators, there are some fun (if not super useful) synth sounds and other random effects. Any effect can have its settings changed with the expression, which makes it doubly useful. And it&#39;s true-bypass, so even if you&#39;re worried about Patented Line 6 Tone altering your signal, it&#39;s alright. Personally, I would never use the preamp and distortion sounds, they&#39;re just not that good, but for single-use sounds you don&#39;t want to add a whole pedal for... why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;seymour-duncan-deja-vu&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Seymour Duncan Deja Vu &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#seymour-duncan-deja-vu&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little-known delay with a hugely useful feature set and a great, live-friendly layout. There&#39;s tap tempo that can be set to either delay at the exact tempo you press, or at measure divisions, e.g. you tap the quarter note but it&#39;ll delay on a dotted eighth. It has an analog circuit simulator (cuts a lot of highs out of the repeats) with variable modulation (warble, basically) and you can dial any combination between the digital and analog for a lot of tonal variation. You can switch between tails or true bypass (I usually leave tails on and it doesn&#39;t really suck tone at all). As a bonus, cranking the delay speed knob way over will give you a looper function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if all that wasn&#39;t enough, you can plug a TRS into its &amp;quot;insert&amp;quot; jack and put a whole chain of effects there that will only effect the repeats. That&#39;s what the Boss PS-2 is doing there: adding either compounding delays or pitch shifts to the repeats. Insane possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s basically the best delay pedal I&#39;ve ever used, and the right combination of simple and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;catalinbread-topanga&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Catalinbread Topanga &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#catalinbread-topanga&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switch reverbs out sometimes but this one is too fun to leave at home. It&#39;s supposed to be an emulation of a Fender spring reverb unit. Yes, you can get some super wet Dick Dale sounds out of it. One of its more enjoyable features is that it&#39;s sensitive to volume and creates breakup as you feed it a louder signal. Made in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hotone-wally&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Hotone Wally &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#hotone-wally&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may never figure out how to pronounce Hotone, but the Wally is a great little looper. You can stack a lot of loops of different times, you can change their pitch after you&#39;ve recorded, and change the output volume of the playback. Great features for a tiny pedal. Unfortunately with its single button it&#39;s complicated to control and you can&#39;t end a loop at an exact time. And believe it or not, for most boards it&#39;s actually a little too small. I can&#39;t manage to get enough Velcro on the thing to keep it from moving around, and there&#39;s nowhere to zip-tie it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tc-voicelive-not-pictured&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;TC Voicelive (not pictured) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#tc-voicelive-not-pictured&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empty space usually has my vocal processor on it. This thing is basically just delays, but it has some sort of compression and possibly EQ in it because everything comes out of it sounding so polished. It was purchased by my bandmate from Mike Scheidt, so it&#39;s seen some action but it&#39;s really tough. Unlike many other vocal effects I&#39;ve used, sound people do not hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-board&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Board &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#the-board&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board itself is a handmade wooden job that a friend built at a custom size for a pretty meager amount of money. I painted and velcro&#39;d it, and even though it doesn&#39;t have a case and the slats can be a bit weird for the odd form-factor pedals like the Deja Vu, it&#39;s solid and really does the trick. The power supply is hidden out of sight and I have been able to velcro-tie the extra cabling. I just need to get an angled plug into that Topanga...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>When you &quot;have&quot; to do a focus group</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/when-you-have-to-do-a-focus-group/"/>
		<updated>2019-04-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/when-you-have-to-do-a-focus-group/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most UX researchers will parrot the line that focus groups are terrible, and even if they are parroting, they&#39;re right. Erika Hall, in &lt;em&gt;Just Enough Research&lt;/em&gt;, calls focus groups &amp;quot;research theater.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often, you&#39;ll find that budget and/or time constraints can manipulate your beautifully planned user research into a focus group. Is there anything you can do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Pentagram and other gatekeeping haters be damned, design thinking (or human-centered design) comes to the rescue. Co-design doesn&#39;t just mean working in cross-functional teams in your own organization, it means involving your users. If we truly believe that they know best, then why not involve them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I got access to a group of young people who were acting as an advisory board to a client. The client made e-learning modules for an urban teen market and we were building the interface and helping with their product design philosophy. The problem with this access was that not only were the kids biased — they had volunteered for the position and were paid a stipend — but when they got together they were effectively a focus group. All of them were smart and motivated, but they weren&#39;t always motivated to give the kind of feedback we needed, and we continued to see patterns of one person leading the group (a standard focus group behavior).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we met them regularly, I started to give them homework. They put together mood boards and talked about the kinds of sites they regularly visited. Maybe they all colluded, but it didn&#39;t matter quite as much because it was an intentional collaboration on their part in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we eased into some design thinking exercises, and conducted a design studio workshop. I instructed them to think of the particular details of what made them frustrated with, apathetic to, or unable to operate the current layouts. Then they drew. Standard practice applies here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were remote, but I instructed the moderators to give them sharpies so we didn&#39;t fall into the detailed drawing trap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The youth liaison to the company, as well as the product leader and another product manager, participated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The drawings were timeboxed, then presented and lightly critiqued as a group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took pictures and sent them to us, and we did affinity mapping and more detailed analysis after the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is really rocket surgery, but it&#39;s worth mentioning that as long as you have the right participants, any user research should be considered useful and there&#39;s a lot of value in being able to &amp;quot;make lemonade.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one is tough. Mark Hollis recently passed, and that was difficult to process but in the musical sense he was already gone, having left a near-perfect legacy of forward-thinking avant-pop that to most people&#39;s minds invented post-rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Walker on the other hand, despite his age, was still fairly prolific, especially considering his attention to craft and detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of at least 4 moments where he defied expectations: Quitting teen idoldom to write music, &lt;em&gt;Scott 4&lt;/em&gt;, his songs on &lt;em&gt;Nite Flights&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Climate of Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, which really established the rest of his career. There was nothing else on earth like them. There was nobody on earth like &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. And there never will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I consider design thinking, it matters less to me whether it leads to a lot of bad design or not. What matters to me is whether it helps broaden the language of design, if it helps expand the community of design, if it helps build a world that values and understands design better than it does today. If design thinking is making us more relevant to the world at large, leading non-designers to embrace the way designers think, then the net effect strikes me as positive.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/kill-your-personas-1c332d4908cc&quot;&gt;headline is bait&lt;/a&gt; and the sentiment is a little radical — as someone who&#39;s been working with more behavioral-based personas for a long time, I&#39;d say there&#39;s plenty of use personas still have as a design tool. It&#39;s just that people, especially marketers, have been using them poorly for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft&#39;s inclusive &amp;quot;persona spectrum&amp;quot; idea is great. It helps to demonstrate that accessibility and inclusion aren&#39;t just about (for instance) serving blind users, they&#39;re about serving everyone in as many cases as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://measuringu.com/pure/&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; came out early last year, but PURE is a new-to-me usability evaluation method from Intel Security and the master of UX metrics, Jeff Sauro. I&#39;m always looking for low-impact, low-cost ways of evaluating the usability of features before (or, god forbid, in lieu of) a full moderated test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, that can be done. Even if you&#39;re against the idea as a useful method on its own, it can point to the places that need to have full testing done on them. PURE is nice because a decently-trained person can do it without having to hold tons of heuristic guidelines in their head. And you get a pretty nice-looking chart result at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/example_pure.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve created a spreadsheet that calculates up the scores, and some Figma components to build the chart. I think this might be the case I&#39;ve been looking for to develop a tool for Figma using their API.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Design Thinking Considered Harmful</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/design-thinking-considered-harmful/"/>
		<updated>2018-10-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/design-thinking-considered-harmful/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not long after the recent Fast Co &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90166804/design-thinking-is-b-s&quot;&gt;article by the bigtime Pentagram designer&lt;/a&gt;  about how Design Thinking sucks, here&#39;s that bastion of both design and progressive thinking, the...  &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/09/design-thinking-is-fundamentally-conservative-and-preserves-the-status-quo&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;? The thing that the author is mad about does not seem to be the kind of design thinking that I have either implemented or learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of &amp;quot;human centered design&amp;quot; is to eliminate the concept of the designer dictating from on high. The version the author refers to, where a holy anointed designer filters the input of the unwashed masses, is something I&#39;m wholly against as well. After all, I went to a two-year for-profit design school. Iskander has the right idea: we should be democratizing design and acting on the bottom-up, boots-on-the-ground perspective that we get from users/customers/beneficiaries and from non-designers in our organization. Unfortunately, it feels to me like she&#39;s been given a tainted version of design thinking -- one that I think a lot of other people have also received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cognitive dissonance here is that these articles written by people named Natasha can&#39;t both be true. Jen, highfalutin Pentagram partner, can&#39;t be right about design thinking usurping the dominance of designers like her while Iskander is simultaneously right about the methods actually maintaining that dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, design thinking is, as Iskander says, a dumbed-down scientific method. So to my mind, what you do with that hypothesize-and-test framework can be conservative (blarg), innovative (bleh), or serve people well, depending on your hypotheses, the makeup of your team, and the projects you&#39;re working on. Keep the tools in your toolbox, keep serving the people you&#39;re designing for, and you&#39;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s cool video with Tony Visconti discussing the creation of &amp;quot;Heroes,&amp;quot; the title song of maybe the best of Bowie&#39;s Berlin albums. It&#39;s amazing just to hear the multi tracks — Fripp&#39;s brilliant feedback guitar, the crack band, and Bowie&#39;s vocal takes, which get written about a lot but prove his power when you hear them on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;d be easy to take away that the era of true studio innovation with giant budgets and beautiful studios is mostly at an end so we&#39;ll never get great records like this anymore, but it&#39;s all there available to us. You could recreate so many of these things and more in your own house. The inspiration is what&#39;s important, and there&#39;s a lot of it in this video.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the more fun things about playing electronic music is figuring out how to perform live. To some people, Ableton Live and its external controllers made the question moot. And to a large number of others, Elektron’s highly playable devices have become the de facto way of low-impact performance design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you’re not interested in bringing out a computer and you don’t have nice Elektron stuff, creating a way to connect and perform on your equipment is a fun and sometimes ridiculous challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various Reasons, for me, has always been about this. And usually it’s been a little too complicated and unreliable to make things easy to play. But discovering some of the features of my Alesis Micron has really opened up my options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-it-is&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;What it is &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/synthesizin/#what-it-is&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, my setup starts with the (non-pro) Arturia BeatStep, which mostly provides master clock but runs the sequence on a couple songs. It’s a fun way to run things because even though I can’t hard-wire a tempo to songs, the analog clock helps me go by “feel” a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the MIDI chain goes to the Micron, which can run a multi-track sequencer. Unfortunately, having multiple sequences in songs means holding down keys and moving your finger around. That’s fine in some cases, and in others I’ve adapted tunes to use the same bassline moved around in key. There can even be rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, a whole song can be built on the Micron, but I consider my modded Alesis HR-16 to be a signature part of my sound. So that is next in the chain. The snare runs to a cheap delay pedal to help alter sounds and add dubby effects to the beats. From there, I send MIDI clock to my Arturia Microbrute, which is almost always running an arpeggiator timed to that clock. It goes through a preamp for distortion and a Catalinbread spring reverb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece is a Korg Volca Keys. I use it for pads, leads, and with
the aid of a Hotone Wally looper, transitions between songs for less awkward silence while I change patches. The hardest part of this is hitting keys, but I don’t have a small enough MIDI controller to justify bringing out something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/vrsrsns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the simplest setup I have. There are quite a few connections, and a couple analog synths with no patch recall. It does make changing parts within songs much easier than my previous setup, which had me running around like a crazy person trying to change patterns on multiple sequencers — some of which require two fingers. It’s got a bit of a shambolic timing, which is not ideal in some cases, but a lot more interesting and unique than a perfect computer or Octatrack clock. An audience member described it as “raw,” but to excerpt some of the lyrics, it’s also a mess of tangled wires.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the quest for audio perfection, I&#39;ve found myself trying yet another tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it was thanks to a mastering project — at the end of the day I still ended up doing mastering in DSP-Quattro, an unreliable piece of software that nevertheless is a dedicated mastering DAW. When you need things like crossfades, effects on regions, and DDP export... you need them. It&#39;s another 300 bucks to upgrade Studio One to the version that has a mastering workflow, so guess who isn&#39;t doing that? I&#39;m continually frustrated by DSP-Quattro&#39;s odd workflows and constant crashing, but it does the job eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, I gave REAPER a shot at it. If you&#39;re not familiar, Reaper (it&#39;s an acronym but I get really tired of capitalizing it) is a constantly-developing DAW that carries a $60 price tag for amateurs and $225 for pros. My impression of Reaper has always been that it&#39;s a technician&#39;s tool or &amp;quot;computer person&amp;quot; version of a DAW. That is to say, kind of the opposite of Pro Tools&#39;s heavy mimicry of a console-based workflow. One thing that its proponents are always fond of pimping is the customization. Reaper can, within reason, work any way you want it to, but there&#39;s a massive learning and setup curve to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe not. Turns out, it isn&#39;t that hard to do a lot of the customizations that force Reaper to work the way you want to work, from tool behavior to making F3 toggle the mixer like Pro Tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sounds at least as good as Studio One, and has a much cleaner, more native-feeling interface than it used to. And I think that the the &amp;quot;computer-like&amp;quot; focus of the UI as opposed to slavish console worship is actually a strength. There are no audio or MIDI tracks, just &lt;em&gt;tracks&lt;/em&gt;, and there are no groups, VCAs, or busses. Every track can be anything, so it supports an &amp;quot;as you go&amp;quot; creative workflow. Takes and playlists work easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortcoming that most DAWs run up against versus Pro Tools is always audio editing, so that remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to continue any client work that comes along in Studio One, but try the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://anemptyroom.net/&quot;&gt;An Empty Room&lt;/a&gt; recording with Reaper and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rachel Andrew, the Guru of Grids, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/01/you-do-not-need-a-css-grid-based-grid-system/&quot;&gt;why you don&#39;t need a &amp;quot;Grid Framework&amp;quot; to use CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt;. For me, part of the desire to use grid is right here — the additional overhead of throwing in a grid system is just unnecessary. And with Grid comes horizontal and vertical alignment, markup without containers, and so many more possibilities for layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even fallbacks, one reason frameworks tend to get popular, aren&#39;t needed in her estimation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create solid markup, uncluttered by additional elements that the past tells you that you need. Design your site using what Grid and other new methods have to offer. Then look at how you deal with the browsers without support, by serving them something slightly simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Edge fully supports Grid, it&#39;s probably time to stop farting around and really learn it, now that I&#39;ve finally embraced flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Is the golden age of UX really over, and what does that really mean</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/the-golden-age-of-ux/"/>
		<updated>2017-08-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/the-golden-age-of-ux/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe the &amp;quot;golden age of UX&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.marvelapp.com/golden-age-ux/&quot;&gt;really is over&lt;/a&gt;. I think a better way to put it is that we&#39;ve been discovered out here in our clubhouse and now we&#39;re gonna have to grow up and play ball with everyone else. But this widely-shared article from Marvel (a tool I like a lot) has missed the mark in a couple fundamental ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, strategy is not for everyone. We did what I think is a great job designing strategy at D&amp;amp;B, and it was in itself a design challenge. But not everyone on the team was involved or wanted to be involved. Disparaging non-strategic UX as a &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; role is an insulting mistake. This is skilled practitioner stuff, and there are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; very few people who are actually good at it. The fact that there are exponentially more UX designers out there doesn&#39;t mean there are infinitely more good ones, especially since new folks are being raised on hot takes. So trying to convince the relatively few good ones to move on to strategic roles in companies that still need their user advocacy is not gonna help those companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially if your next aim is to get those designers on the growth or marketing trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Growth hacking&amp;quot; is what UX designers are destined for now? Or social media marketing? Turn me into glue now, then, thanks. UX efforts are necessary in all of these worlds, and product marketing is inextricably tied to product design — but the core tenets of UX are unaffected by Valley trends (like &amp;quot;growth hacking&amp;quot;) or marketing efforts, which are famous for attempting to &lt;em&gt;subvert&lt;/em&gt; the true needs of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s not lose the voice of the user in an attempt to stay relevant to a fad-driven Product Hunting world. And if the going wisdom is &amp;quot;we solved that, time to move the talented designers on to growth hacking and marketing,&amp;quot; then I&#39;d consider that all the more reason why UX is still badly needed on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/on-mistral/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://magenta.as/forget-comic-sans-mistral-is-the-typeface-you-should-love-to-hate-de799d9ea897&quot;&gt;the article itself&lt;/a&gt; disproves the thesis that Mistral is patently hateable— in fact the piece eased my own distaste for it. I am plenty old enough to remember a time before Comic Sans and Papyrus when Mistral was the only typeface to loathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One point that I think is key is that it was one of the few extant fonts, let alone ones that business owners had access to, that would approximate handwriting or graffiti. It&#39;s a big reason Comic Sans persists, and presumably why sites like Creative Market are flooded with handwritten custom typefaces. I find it hard to hate on small business owners who wanted their signs or truck stickers to be less brutalist. A world where an otherwise solid piece of art like &lt;em&gt;Straight Outta Compton&lt;/em&gt; can be packaged in crap design is a more fun world, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mall is a capable, arguably influential designer and writer on the web. It&#39;s always cool to see how the sausage is made, but even cooler to see that a person with his credentials has &lt;a href=&quot;https://danmall.com/posts/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/&quot;&gt;a framework&lt;/a&gt; for creative &amp;quot;theft&amp;quot; as a basis for starting new designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&#39;re experienced, you start to internalize these kinds of layout patterns. But while recently working on a website, I realized I hadn&#39;t designed one in a very long time and was pretty unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of a site these days. This would&#39;ve been a great way to get rolling, and I might try it for the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just kidding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/simple-human/inline-validation-is-problematic-399dd01d436f&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; didn&#39;t really use that word. And rather than an alarmist view, this is a fairly measured take. However, most of the arguments are actually against &lt;em&gt;realtime&lt;/em&gt; (onblur) validation, not &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two years dealing with some serious problems that were born entirely out of the fact that an application used realtime+inline validation. And that was primarily in a series of wizard-like dialogs, which really didn&#39;t make any sense (the pattern of &amp;quot;disable the continue button until validation is cleared&amp;quot; would&#39;ve worked well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problems included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forms that didn&#39;t require a certain order to filling them out, but validation that did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;false positives triggered by mouse actions that left users in an unresolvable state if they clicked &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;field groups often in a false-positive state (point #4 in the article)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t the same as saying that &lt;em&gt;per-field&lt;/em&gt; validation is wrong, and I still strongly believe in that, but this article has a lot of solid points.&lt;/p&gt;

Other than the wide trend toward cranking the size that&#39;s been going on for a few years, really solid type work on the web is only recently coming into its own. It&#39;s kind of like when Khoi Vinh popularized grids a few years back; it made me wonder how many folks in this business have even studied design. I think it&#39;s great when people with more formal knowledge spread it to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to type though, it&#39;s only been recently that we&#39;ve been able to have a real level of control over it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Switching to Studio One</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/switching-to-studio-one/"/>
		<updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/switching-to-studio-one/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently worked to record my band&#39;s new EP, and decided to do something I don&#39;t normally have the opportunity to do when someone&#39;s paying me: I changed my DAW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backstory: my Mac is starting to become inoperable due to the longstanding need for operating system updates. Recently Chrome decided it didn&#39;t like my version of Mac OS anymore. But if I start moving to the California editions, I have to switch to Pro Tools 12. And if you don&#39;t know what that means, imagine moving from Adobe CS to Creative Cloud. Yeah, I sunk a lot of money into Pro Tools and I&#39;m not really into paying $25 a month or $300 for a year at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I pulled out some old You Might Think We&#39;re Sharks base tracks from our last session that never got overdubs, and finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/soundofsharks/summer-moon&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Summer Moon&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; in Presonus Studio One, which I&#39;ve been threatening to switch to for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It went well, so I recorded An Empty Room&#39;s new one on it as well. There are some tradeoffs, but overall it&#39;s just a better experience and I wish I&#39;d done it sooner. One thing I missed from Cubase is that the music creation and mixing portions were well integrated. In recent years since dropping Cubase, I tend to compose in Ableton, then finalize and mix in Pro Tools. In Studio One, though it&#39;s obviously not the same as Ableton, I&#39;m able to integrate composition, tracking, and mixing pretty well. That works for our workflow since we&#39;ll add synths and samples in the mix process after doing the tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native compatibility with my hardware, which is made by Presonus as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost everything is faster. To send tracks to a bus, just select them all, right click, and select &amp;quot;Create Bus from selected tracks.&amp;quot; No more routing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track presets and plugin groups (so you can save an entire chain of plugins that you use often).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock EQ has a frequency analyzer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VSTs and AUs are invariably cheaper and more available than AAX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comping is incredible. Just highlight each part of the take (&amp;quot;Layer&amp;quot; in Studio One) you want to promote and it&#39;s done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fades are automatic (like Ableton), and they can be tweaked with bezier curves, as can automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragging and dropping, in most cases, replaces menus and routing. Even importing audio files: just drag them in, and when you save the file Studio One asks if you want to copy the audio files to the project directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of version 3.4, there is a Smart Tool just like Pro Tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I miss the single-stroke keyboard shortcuts. Leaving the modifier keys behind always made me feel like my keyboard was transformed into a spaceship control center. There are a few in S1, but not as many.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By that same token, keyboard focus is sometimes wobbly. You can search for plugins in the Insert/Send menus, which is amazing. But you can&#39;t reliably use the keyboard to select the one you find, and I end up selecting tracks, soloing them, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio stretching is unintuitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Beat Detective equivalent that I know of. I didn&#39;t use it that much anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing like Xpand! in the Artist version, but I recently picked up the VST version for a buck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That&#39;s... about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently using Artist Edition with the iPad remote and VST plugin support upgrades. Most of the features that I would love to have in Pro Edition are not things that Pro Tools even had, like the Arranger Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a small curve, a relatively painless experience, and I didn&#39;t lose much for features. Certainly didn&#39;t lose any fun.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IKEA hacking for the studio</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/ikea-hacking-for-the-studio/"/>
		<updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/ikea-hacking-for-the-studio/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Any time that I spend recording these days tends to be remote, and mixing happens 100% in the box. So loading up the rack spaces in my mix desk with outboard gear doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. Maybe it would if I had some rackmount synths, but I don&#39;t. I previously traveled to remote gigs in a giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarcenter.com/Odyssey/Carpeted-Combo-Mixer-Rack-Case-6-Space-1274115053698.gc&quot;&gt;Odyssey mixer case&lt;/a&gt; with 9 spaces on top and 6 on the bottom. It&#39;s ridiculous, even after adding casters, and near-impossible to load into the truck without risk of a hernia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the smallest portable rack case is crazy expensive for my purposes. I&#39;m not going on tour. I&#39;ll move it occasionally from recording location to studio and back, but it&#39;s never going &amp;quot;on the road.&amp;quot; So after looking around I finally found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/8U-Rack-Case-From-IKEA-RAST-Table/&quot;&gt;simple &amp;quot;IKEA hack.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; Conveniently, the Rast table is 19&amp;quot; wide on the inside and made of unfinished pine. Assembled as-is with some rack rails attached, it&#39;ll hold 6U worth of rack gear. But a slight modification lets it hold 8U. I added handles and a flourescent light in the back, spray painted it black, &lt;em&gt;et voila&lt;/em&gt;, a stupid-simple case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the bigger items like my ART preamp, there isn&#39;t a lot of horizontal room left, but if I ever did this again I think I&#39;d move the rack rails a little farther inside so the knobs were more protected. And for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/44361109/&quot;&gt;$15 at IKEA&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make another attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IKEA Rast - $14.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rack rails - $6.96 x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spray paint - $3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handles - $3 x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total: Under $45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closest thing I could find pre-made: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/RK8&quot;&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/rack_case_sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DIY rack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, my el cheapo signal chain, from the bottom up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBE bass EQ and preamp.&lt;/strong&gt; I dislike the Sonic Maximizer and the &amp;quot;BBE Sound&amp;quot; in general, but this thing will even out a crappy bass guitar and give it some sustain and punch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ART Pro MPA II (Gold Edition) mic preamp.&lt;/strong&gt; ART get no love, but their black 2U tube units (MPA, VLA, Channel) sell for under $200 and they sound good. The Gold Edition swaps tubes for a less hissy gain. I mostly use it on vocals, but if you have to record a guitar direct it&#39;ll give you real tube gain, which will make any plugin amp simulator sound that much more authentic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dbx 266xs compressor.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe the &amp;quot;xs&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;extra shitty&amp;quot; when it comes to dbx&#39;s model line, but honestly it&#39;s still a dbx compressor. Which means it&#39;s pretty transparent and easy to use as well. For vocals I&#39;ll dial in some light compression when recording, but it&#39;s useful as a limiter as well if that&#39;s all you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symetrix 525 compressor.&lt;/strong&gt; I guess these things were originally for radio (duck the music as the DJ talks) but the sound is pretty darn good; I tend to use it to fatten/lengthen the sound of snares. Symetrix compressors have the distinction of being ultra-cheap (now and forever) but somehow approved by the GearSlutz community as useful tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presonus Firestudio Project.&lt;/strong&gt; I now have two of these interfaces because they&#39;re that good. For the money, it&#39;s almost impossible to beat the Presonus stuff. Decent gain on the preamps (could be better for vocals but that&#39;s what the ART is for), low noise, and pretty configurable and versatile. Chaining two is a breeze and gives you 16 mic inputs and 10 stereo outputs for a good bit less than a grand. I have never actually done remote recording with all 16, but in theory you could do a pretty good sized band at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>Front End Style Guides by Anna Debenham</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/front-end-styleguides-by-anna-debenham/"/>
		<updated>2017-01-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/front-end-styleguides-by-anna-debenham/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still pretty into design systems and style-guide driven design, and I&#39;m encouraged that the faddish nature of the conversation around these methods is passing into general wisdom and best practice. But there&#39;s still a lot of knowledge that has yet to be put &amp;quot;out there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Frost and Anna Debenham, who co-hosted a podcast together last year, are two of the biggest public proponents to recently release books on the subject. Whereas Frost&#39;s focuses more on the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; and the philosophy of style-guide-driven design, Debenham&#39;s is very much a &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She first goes through some of the methodologies and techniques that help break designers of the nasty habit of designing by pages: style tiles, element collages, and component libraries. Then she covers the advantages of style guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, it&#39;s all practical. She focuses most of the book on the step by step process of implementing your first style-guide-driven redesign or creation of a component library. Throughout, she answers questions that real people doing real things with real style guides are going to ask: how rigid should I be, what tools should I use, what about maintenance once it&#39;s built... etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&#39;s a short read but dense with useful, practical information from that rare breed — a developer who can write and explain concisely and clearly. If you&#39;ve gotten on board the philosophical train of style guides but aren&#39;t sure where to start, it&#39;s a good buy at $8. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/&quot;&gt;Get it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-jeet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: I spent a lot of time using Jeet on a lot of sites and apps once I discovered it. Thanks, Jeet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve used a lot of CSS frameworks, minimal grids, etc etc. I&#39;ve even made my own, which frankly would&#39;ve worked for this site. But it didn&#39;t work for the more complex purpose I had hoped to apply it to, so I ended up using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeet.gs/&quot;&gt;Jeet&lt;/a&gt;, which is a variation on what this site &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site uses Lost Grid, a PostCSS based system that&#39;s pretty neat. But its creator&#39;s earlier work, Jeet (for Stylus or Sass), is a pretty beautiful creation on its own. Awesomely, it&#39;s now being maintained again by someone else, so it feels alive and pretty safe to use. That&#39;s nice because I&#39;m just not quite ready to throw PostCSS-based tools into production yet. I need speed, and speed means familiarity. That means Sass. I&#39;d encourage anyone looking for a grid that is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; a grid to look at Jeet.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ia.net/know-how/on-icons&quot;&gt;Pretty comprehensive writeup&lt;/a&gt; about the use of icons from the makers of iA Writer, one of the App Store&#39;s most popular overpriced minimalist writing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and short of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Icons alone can&#39;t convey the meaning, causing usability issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text labels without icons are dry and not compelling, which is a UI problem of its own (whether we like that fact or not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both is almost always going to feel like a compromise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... everything is bad, more or less. They advise getting things right without icons in the IA and wireframing stage, then adding on the emotional component as part of UI design. Sound approach, but ultimately we&#39;re still left with icons as a &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; solution that are still mostly unable to convey verbs and abstract concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

It&#39;s even replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm/&quot;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; as my primary recommendation method, although to some degree that&#39;s because it&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; based system where I don&#39;t even have to try. It&#39;s always there for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a downside to this? I don&#39;t really see one. In theory, people used to rely more on others to get their recommendations. This still uses your friends — and people you don&#39;t even know who share your current taste — to push recommendations to you. I actually liberally spam my friends with albums, too. I&#39;d wager that if you were the type to do that before, you&#39;re still doing it, and if you weren&#39;t, you&#39;re getting more recommendations now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a criticism that anything algorithmic is going to by its nature be &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; and work within a set of boundaries, whereas randomly listening to college radio can break you out of your existing sonic box. I suppose that&#39;s valid, but I listen to such a wide variety of genres and popularity levels on Spotify that I don&#39;t really get that effect. Here&#39;s some stuff on the rock end of the spectrum I discovered using the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Semantics vs Objects and other scary CSS animals</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was only a matter of time. The backlash always appears. It&#39;s a pretty old argument to be honest, the idea of getting &amp;quot;back to basics&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;using the web as it was meant to be used.&amp;quot; But the reason that front end devs have gotten a bit away from &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/meaningful-css-style-like-you-mean-it&quot;&gt;these kinds of methods of styling&lt;/a&gt; is that it doesn&#39;t support everything that everyone wants to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d still say that if you&#39;re making a website — even if you&#39;re working with atomic or styleguide-driven design — you&#39;re better off taking advantage of HTML elements, ARIA roles, and the cascade to style your site. But in the world of applications where structure is arbitrary and markup is not necessarily the most readable thing in the world (and guess what, this is often out of our hands), being reusable and &amp;quot;bulletproof&amp;quot; is more important to a lot of front end folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s funny because this debate appears just as I&#39;m finally considering adopting BEM in a project. I love — and need— the idea of a self-contained piece of UI that I can drop anywhere. At its best, this is front-end methodology as UX improvement, because the consistency of those pieces of UI helps the overall experience. Even without that benefit, it aids in speed of dev. Embarrassingly, perhaps the main reason that I gravitated toward BEM is that I&#39;m sick of figuring out what to call things as I place HTML elements on a page.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time a couple months back experimenting with the new version of Reaktor. It doesn&#39;t actually work on my studio computer because it requires Yosemite, so it was something I could handle while at home on my newer Macbook Air (which runs Reaktor surprisingly well). For a cover and the title, I blasphemed the only &lt;a href=&quot;https://parvulusinfectus.bandcamp.com/album/the-mark-ov-force-unspoken&quot;&gt;Parvulus Infectus album&lt;/a&gt; released while we were together.

		<title>Live recording with local band the Nouns</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/"/>
		<updated>2016-01-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDtKS3-N134&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building up a portfolio of recorded, mixed work is not always done by traditional routes. That&#39;s especially true when your primary selling point as a recordist is mobility. I would probably love to get nothing but mix jobs — the work is fun, solitary, and low-pressure as long as you meet deadlines — but the challenges that take me out of my comfort zone are a big part of what make recording interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nouns&lt;/strong&gt; are a hip-hop and jazz crossover with elements of rock and R&amp;amp;B. They have a level of accessibility that jazz groups don&#39;t often achieve, and their talent level is sky-high. Their lineup consists of drums, keys, bass, sax, jazz singer (with some R&amp;amp;B/soul flavor) and an MC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strategy would be to mic them up for multi-tracking but not to get too angsty about bleed. They performed in a barely acoustic-treated music classroom at the University for a video shoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Challenges &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#challenges&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first unique aspect of this session would be running live sound in a small room while simultaneously recording. The drums didn&#39;t need amplification, and the bass and keyboard player both had amps. So I piped everything through my computer in the normal recording chain and produced two separate mixes. I ran a mix of just vocals and saxophone out to three channels of the PA for &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; sound. Then I gave my headphones everything. This worked surprisingly well with Presonus&#39;s Universal Control. It enables up to 4 mixes, but it&#39;s notoriously crash-happy the more you do with it. Thankfully, it held together enough to give me a 3-channel PA routing while recording all 8 channels of audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bass and keys were easy to record: their amps had DIs and I recorded them direct. I loathe DI&#39;d bass sound most of the time, but a little love from EQ in the mix usually helps and practicality won the day this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mics&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mics &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#mics&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sax, a Beta 57 positioned a few inches off the bell and at the middle of the horn gave me a surprisingly good sound with minimal effort. I got tonality, articulation, and detailed reediness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stuck a pair of SM81s in an XY pattern over the drummer&#39;s head. I was able to get them fairly close, given that he&#39;s a jazz drummer with little to no arm swing. The XY of course keeps everything in phase, but it turned out to be a great fit for a unique kit. He uses two snares side by side, and no toms. I supplemented the kit with my old Oktava LDC in the front of the kick. The resulting sound has maybe more room sound than I would care for, and the hats are a bit wild on a couple songs, but it serves the musicality and dynamic range of the jazz style playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singers each got an SM7B. This is a mic I had no experience with but I was pleased. Though it&#39;s a dynamic, it has a lot of detail and really requires a preamp to pull everything out of it. I put it through my cheapo ART Tube MPA preamp (tube-swapped to minimize noise) and my Symetrix 525 compressor/gate. I only took the biggest peaks off; the SM7B&#39;s sound is so smooth, it almost sounds like it&#39;s been hit with a compressor already. The MC gave a great delivery, and I cranked the tube preamp to give him a touch of grit. I had so much drum bleed in the singer&#39;s mic that even the gate wasn&#39;t helping. It&#39;s possible I should have switched her to a handheld, but even changing her position in the room may have helped. You live and learn. At the end of the day, though, an LDC would never have worked and an SM58 wouldn&#39;t have been very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mix&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mix &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#mix&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been into the idea recently of &amp;quot;console-style&amp;quot; mixing. Initially I tried in the obvious choice, the new (v3) version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html&quot;&gt;Harrison Mixbus&lt;/a&gt;, but despite some huge improvements in performance it&#39;s still not quite ready for primetime. I will continue to experiment with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;slate&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Slate &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#slate&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;console&amp;quot; mentality proved a great way to justify trying out the new Slate subscription plugin program. While Avid is getting a lot of flak for moving to a subscription based model for all versions of Pro Tools going forward, Steven Slate is proving that execution (and a lot of brand good will going into it) can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slate VMR and VCC really tied the sound of all the tracks together, and the 3 EQs (SSL and Neve) and two compressors (Opto and 1176) available in VMR are about what I&#39;d normally use. Since this project wouldn&#39;t be mastered, the Slate FG-X would let a non-mastering-engineer like myself put the final touch of volume and polish on the tunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-plugins&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Other Plugins &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#other-plugins&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the closeness of the overheads, I feel like the XY pattern gave me a bit too much room sound and the room really wasn&#39;t a great one. So I hit them with a bit of Tokyo Dawn&#39;s Proxmity plugin, an ingenious combo of reverb, compression, and EQ that can make sources sit closer or farther away in the mix. For the bass, I shamelessly applied Waves Renaissance Axx compression going into the Slate VMR. Surprisingly, I didn&#39;t use the Maag EQ4 on the singer. This had a lot to do with the drum bleed throwing unwanted frequencies into her mic; I needed to do more surgery on specific frequencies. The Maag has smart frequencies but they&#39;re fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;roundup&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Roundup &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#roundup&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a challenging recording situation. But with the exception of a few specific issues, the mix came together well. So I might have done something right. More than any other session, Shure saved the day. The Beta 57, far from being a &amp;quot;just good enough&amp;quot; versatile mic, was magic on the sax. And I can understand why the SM7B is such a popular microphone. But the stars of the show were really the SM81s. The simple drum mic setup worked great for jazz, and might make me rethink how I deal with a rock kit next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>RIP to the man who fell to earth</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Probably doesn&#39;t come as any surprise to anyone that I am, and have been for as long as I can remember, a &lt;strong&gt;David Bowie&lt;/strong&gt; fan. I heard the news early on because I was up late on Sunday night. We all regarded the first tweets skeptically, because people &amp;quot;die&amp;quot; on Twitter all the time and there was a big death hoax with the release of &lt;em&gt;The Next Day&lt;/em&gt;. But it was verified sadly by his son, the director Duncan Jones. Suddenly his new album took on a new significance. The lyrics aren&#39;t cryptic anymore, just like that. And in roll the thinkpieces and tributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s only in hindsight that I realize what songs like &amp;quot;Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Suicide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Life on Mars?&amp;quot; did for me as a nerdy, weird, depressed kid. Bowie probably changed my path — for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow the ultimate outsider hero also cut across so many types of people that the response was near-universal. I suppose everyone feels like an outsider, and he managed to tell them &amp;quot;oh no love, you&#39;re not alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Rebirth of Swans</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/the-rebirth-of-swans/"/>
		<updated>2015-12-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/the-rebirth-of-swans/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2007, I had seen pretty much every Angels of Light or Michael Gira solo tour that had happened since the breakup of Swans. I was pretty burnt my missing the final Swans Are Dead tour so I took every opportunity. Then Gira released a new Angels album with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron/Family&quot;&gt;Akron/Family&lt;/a&gt; as the backing band. It&#39;s all fairly repetitive and hypnotic compared to earlier Angels of Light records, but &amp;quot;Black River Song&amp;quot; in particular kind of exploded my mind when I heard it. Combined with the cover art by Deryk Thomas, who also painted &lt;em&gt;Love of Life&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;White Light From The Mouth of Infinity&lt;/em&gt; covers, it all added up to Swans. I couldn&#39;t stop listening to the tune, and probably telling everyone I knew that this meant Swans were coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4dtWxP8O03qn4yl0P7HXzj&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the advent of the Swans reboot, Michael Gira repeatedly told a wonderful yarn. Seth of Akron/Family hit a huge chord on stage and it made Gira realize that he wanted more Swans. But when I listen to this tune, I still feel like it was there, dying to get out. And given that he&#39;s done what might be his best stuff since the reboot, I&#39;m pretty glad it was.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t really noticed the downside of Sketch on the Mac App Store — except for the reason that I don&#39;t have the App Store version. Bohemian couldn&#39;t offer a Sketch 3 upgrade to App Store customers, so I got the standard version. Updates come very regularly, and apparently that&#39;s one of the major problems they have. I guess this trend has a chance of making Apple change some things. Sketch has to be a decent amount of lost revenue, and maybe more importantly, it&#39;s a high-profile Apple Design Award winning app.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some musical acts who get long in the tooth sustain themselves through constant reinvention, like David Bowie. Others, like Iron Maiden, keep their old hits from sounding tired by pushing themselves to make great new music. And plenty (Springsteen, the Stones) keep flying by on the strength of their live performance regardless of the weakness of their current output. Kraftwerk manage to grab the best parts of all of these by continually refreshing their classic music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We traveled all the way to Detroit for only a long weekend, and it was basically just to see Kraftwerk. How many more tours do Ralf Hutter and the gang have in them? I don&#39;t want to be on the wrong end of that question, having never seen them. Pete told me their shows were boring. Kris told me whatever, the visuals are good and you know all the songs. This is pretty right-on. The visuals, this time in 3D, were a fantastic future-retro mix of graphics and video all completely synced with the tunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started with zero buildup, launching into &amp;quot;Numbers&amp;quot; so fast that much of the theater hadn&#39;t gotten seated. They updated the beat that launched a million electro singles into a super powerful, booming dance assault. Apparently Kraftwerk&#39;s people enter a venue, evaluate it, and supplement the sound system wherever necessary. And it shows. The sound was powerful but pristine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of updating the songs began with &lt;em&gt;The Mix&lt;/em&gt;, but they now sound even better — the beats have &lt;em&gt;The Mix&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s dancefloor focus but the sounds and synths feel more like ultra-high-fidelity versions of the originals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a not-great but not-distorted phone clip of &amp;quot;Radioactivity,&amp;quot; possibly the most dramatic update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9-esZKFVv4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the largest response came for the beginning of the second set, &amp;quot;The Robots.&amp;quot; It&#39;s ironic because the applause was for the old-school Kraftwerk &amp;quot;robot&amp;quot; mannequins, who took the stage instead of the members. The rest of the time, the group wore uniforms I can only describe as &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;-like, which lit up to correspond with each song&#39;s projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a great show and a great classic Detroit venue to see it. It makes an all-day trek with a near-3-year-old just about worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In Every City? Wire&#39;s Drill</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-every-city-wires-drill/"/>
		<updated>2015-09-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-every-city-wires-drill/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I had a friend who shrugged off the idea of Wire records after &lt;em&gt;154&lt;/em&gt;, because they &amp;quot;started doing techno or something.&amp;quot; That&#39;s narrow and inaccurate, but that&#39;s how we thought. And anyway, though they used synths the music was more like a left-field pop — and the &amp;quot;p&amp;quot; word is even more damning than &amp;quot;techno.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for my friend&#39;s comment, though, may have been a &amp;quot;single&amp;quot; that Wire put out during their second phase. The song is &amp;quot;Drill,&amp;quot; from &lt;em&gt;The Ideal Copy&lt;/em&gt;. It features no less than 9 different reworkings, remixes, and live performances of the song that often bear no resemblance to the original. It&#39;s a fun release that hangs alright on its own because the versions are all different. Here&#39;s one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PS28biAEBqo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the versions are very industrial in tone, with processed vocals, textures made of samples, heavy programmed beats, and an almost-danceable pulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you knew me at the time I owned the cassette, you were probably subjected to &lt;em&gt;The Drill&lt;/em&gt; repeatedly in my Dodge Spirit. I apologize, but only a little.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>In Praise of the Alesis SR-16</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-the-alesis-sr16/"/>
		<updated>2015-09-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-the-alesis-sr16/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was somewhat surprised recently to see that some people on the group-buying site Massdrop were attempting to get a group together for the Alesis SR-16 drum machine. At its regular street price, the SR-16 is at the same price point as a lot of other newer, more fashionable machines. The Volca Beats is an insanely fun, great-sounding, compact true analog 808 clone for the same coin. Boss continues to make good drum machines for the same or not much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And recently I&#39;ve been in multiple conversations about how the Alesis brand is mostly garbage. This is a shame, at least for the sake of a few great machines — The Micron/Ion keyboards are among the best synths to come out of the now-passé virtual analog era — but most notably for the SR-16. It&#39;s somewhat hard to love, but it&#39;s also hard to deny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/hr.16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HR-16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alesis produced the very first 16-bit sampling drum machine, the HR-16. Previous sample-based machines, like Oberheim&#39;s DMX and the Linn LM-1, were 8 or 12-bit. &amp;quot;HR&amp;quot; stood for high resolution and it really wasn&#39;t a pose. The samples were good, they had multiple velocity levels, and they were tunable. But there was, as with all machines of the time, a single kit worth of sounds to choose from. I use one, and I replaced the internal chips with Linn LM-1 sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/sr.16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SR-16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 1993, and the successor to the HR-16 didn&#39;t do much for innovation, but it added every feature you might want in a drum machine. There were velocity-dependent samples: if you hit a pad harder you&#39;d hear a sample of a drummer hitting the drum harder, rather than just the same sample at higher volume. There were two drum &amp;quot;fills&amp;quot; for each pattern, so that switching between patterns was less robotic and more realistic. For live standalone users, there were two foot pedal inputs for changing patterns hands-free on stage. But if you wanted to use the unit as a sound module, the MIDI implementation was more complete than anything on the market. Godflesh upgraded their HR-16 to an SR-16, and I started playing fairly Godflesh-like music with one, recording my ideas to 4-track. It also powered my first industrial/experimental band for quite a while before finally giving up the ghost after about 10 years of beats (I still have it and I&#39;m sure it could be made operational again). But as long as it lasted and as useful as it was, I&#39;m surprised that it&#39;s still made. More power to it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Put the &quot;designers should code&quot; debate to rest</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/should-designers-code-omg/"/>
		<updated>2015-09-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/should-designers-code-omg/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-haystack.com/2015/09/02/put-the-designers-should-code-debate-to-rest/&quot;&gt;Good read&lt;/a&gt;. The likelihood of that debate ever ending is small. But the point here is awesome. It&#39;s not about your skillset. It&#39;s about the fact that you&#39;re trying to describe a Picasso by farting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me several years to come to that opinion and it hasn’t changed much, but it wasn’t the coding that was important. It was the movement away from symbolic representations of that which we were designing. It was about not using flat images as a poor proxy for something that’s different for different people on different devices in different browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Enhancing Kirby with local workflows</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/"/>
		<updated>2015-09-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m enjoying using Kirby to write my blog. It feels more connected to the rest of the site, more in my control, and more &amp;quot;not $5 a month to operate a separate virtual server running Node to have a Ghost blog.&amp;quot; But the Kirby Panel, great for spot changes in your content, is not where you want to live every day for blogging. Fortunately, Kirby is a flat-file system that allows users to add content by simply uploading it. So now I&#39;m blogging locally in my favorite Markdown editor and distraction-free writing tool, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bywordapp.com/&quot;&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;. There are two parts to making this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;automator&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Automator &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/#automator&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of the solution uses Automator, Mac OS X&#39;s super powerful and under-utilized workflow creator. I love it, although it&#39;s not always intuitive how to do what you need. Essentially this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asks for a name that will eventually be the permalink of the Kirby post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates a folder in my local &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; folder with that title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copies a text file template into that folder with the name &lt;code&gt;article.txt&lt;/code&gt; (which is what Kirby needs to associate it with the &amp;quot;article&amp;quot; template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens that file in Byword, where I can fill it out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I write the post, the second part comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dropzone&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Dropzone &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/#dropzone&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/&quot;&gt;Dropzone 3.5&lt;/a&gt; was recently released, and it&#39;s a nice update to a super useful program. Imagine internet (not just web) bookmarks, file actions, and shortcuts, all rolled into one simple place. You can click actions or drag files and folders onto them, depending on what they are. So in order to publish a post, I just take the newly created folder and drag it onto an FTP shortcut I made in Dropzone. Bam, blogged. And I never have to write anything into another web interface again if I don&#39;t want to. Thanks to Kirby&#39;s self-contained content style, I can put any images for the post into that folder and they&#39;ll work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I added the Automator action to Dropzone as well so I can both write and upload the post from Dropzone. It&#39;s a handy little tool that&#39;s a good buy at 5 bucks. Only downside I&#39;ve encountered so far is that it can&#39;t upload folders to an S3 bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Smokin&#39;</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/smokin/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shortly after moving, I realized that despite the often-rainy Oregon weather, I was going to need another grill. We&#39;d given the old gas chugger away back in Texas. It was too small, a little persnickity, and basically had one temperature (&amp;quot;hot as it&#39;ll go,&amp;quot; which was increasingly &amp;quot;not that hot&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some online reading and talking to a couple people, I came to the Kamado style grill and ended up with the Char-Griller Akorn. Last year&#39;s model was dirt cheap on Amazon and Prime-ready, so in a day I was up and running. The chief appeal of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamado&quot;&gt;kamado&lt;/a&gt;, popularized in the West by the Big Green Egg, is that you can get crazy hot with it but also control super low temperatures for long periods. So it lends itself not only to making a pizza with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35P2wTX0zg&quot;&gt;super hot fire&lt;/a&gt; but smoking a brisket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Fourth, I brought some smoked stuff to the neighbors&#39; party — he&#39;s a carne asada connoisseur, but she&#39;s a vegetarian. So I took it upon myself to see if Real Texas Flavor could be transferred to a mouth without riding on a dead animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a bit online but not many people were doing it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonhardin.com/smoking-tofu/&quot;&gt;This person&lt;/a&gt; gave me the marinade idea: basically one part rice wine vinegar to two parts soy sauce. As meat eaters who&#39;ve tried it will attest, tofu doesn&#39;t really have a lot of flavor. So slicing the bricks lengthwise in half then marinating them for about a day in this salty/tangy, vaguely Japanese solution gave it a great savory start before it even hit the wood. After that, I got the hickory going as low as it would go, waited for the good thin blue smoke (you do that, don&#39;t you? Don&#39;t tell me you cook over that white shit), and sat the half-bricks down for about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to what I expected, they gained a little more chew. I&#39;m not sure where that comes from, but if you&#39;ve ever had smoked cheese you know what I&#39;m talking about. A little rind, a little denser texture. In the case of spongey-ass tofu, it worked well. It had the texture of tofu that&#39;d been pressed for weeks, not the couple hours I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results? I loved it, both neighbors loved it, a few people declared it the best tofu they&#39;d ever had. And it really did have a taste reminiscent of Texas BBQ.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea of not hiding options is appealing. I wonder where along the way we (collectively) stopped putting radios out there — it&#39;s probably in the interest of keeping UIs &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; and concise. But concise is a function of the actual design of fields and we need to fight for easier controls and fewer options, not a visually appealing mess.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever worked with me, you know that playing with small to medium content management systems is a hobby of mine. Last year I settled on Kirby as my system of choice for running my own website. However, I was keeping my blog on a Digital Ocean droplet running Node and Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghost is definitely a more modern, slick system that I&#39;ve been really pleased with. But I did want to consolidate things into a single site. So my new blog and RSS feed are operated on the same Kirby system as the rest of my site. If nothing else, I didn&#39;t have to learn anything about the server, the templating tools, or anything else in order to get it redesigned and fit in. Flexibility was important — now I can have my own fields and post types pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since both systems are reliant on Markdown for content and Ghost has a handy simple JSON export, porting was not a big deal. Let me know if you see any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Photoshop Design Spaces</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/ps-design-spaces/"/>
		<updated>2015-06-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/ps-design-spaces/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subtraction.com/2015/06/16/photoshop-design-space/&quot;&gt;This feels like a step in the right direction&lt;/a&gt;. One of the arguments that persists despite Photoshop adding tons of new and relevant screen design features in recent months is that the old granddaddy does too many things. It had great features for photographers and retouchers, great features for graphic designers, great features for UI designers, and all that adds up to &amp;quot;too many features.&amp;quot; No one person is likely to use everything that Photoshop offers anymore. So we&#39;re left with feature weight, function weight, and interface weight, while upstarts like Sketch barrel in with a limited toolset and huge efficiency of performance and UI. Design Spaces appear to directly acknowledge and address this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinh is wrong about one thing though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me about this situation is how remarkable it is that it exists at all; the Adobe of a decade ago seemed to have little or no interest in what was important to web and interface designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adobe of a decade ago was still putting resources into Fireworks, the wellspring of all these screen design tools. So if the streamlined interface of the screen Design Space owes a lot to Sketch, it&#39;s good to remember that Sketch didn&#39;t completely come out of nowhere either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite quickly I came to see password-masking as a rut. A design pattern that has been around so long that no one thinks about it much. We all just go through the motions when assembling a log-in screen and add password-masking by default. Lost business and usability issues just come along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really makes u think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not long before this, my team and I got in a fight about this topic, and we won. Pretty cool!)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Writing interface copy</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nicolefenton.com/interface-writing/&quot;&gt;Great stuff from Nicole Fenton&lt;/a&gt;. This is a talk but translates well to a writeup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UI copy gets the shaft so often, not just in terms of the attention it receives but also the way it&#39;s written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write code iteratively, so why not the rest of it? It’s okay if your interface writing isn’t perfect. But you better believe that you need to go back and clean up those strings before you go live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really important. Every project I&#39;ve ever been a part of forgot the &amp;quot;we can improve later&amp;quot; mindset of Agile to some degree when faced with the prospect of launching with imperfect interface copy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stumbled on this a while back when I was big on reading mp3 blogs. In the few years since I regularly trawled those sites for the mysterious and bizarre gems they posted, many of the really sought-after pieces have been reissued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the “Rock In Opposition (R.I.O.)” bands of the 70s, King Crimson was just too simple and pop-oriented. R.I.O. were progressive rock bands from England and Europe who packed so much complexity into their music that the standard prog fans wouldn’t touch them. Their audience consisted of avant weirdos, industrial heads, and fans of more experimental stuff, and their membership was as varied as Henry Cow and This Heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgian chamber rock band Univers Zero were one of the most intense R.I.O. groups, and Heresie is the best and darkest of their work. It’s sonically dissonant and very, very oppressive sounding in both its density of notes and darkness of mood. Perfect lights-off, scare-yourself music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tim Armstrong&#39;s obsession with both rap and violence, which came to a head with his and Travis Barker&#39;s awful group the Transplants, is nothing new.&lt;/li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I was buying cables in Guitar Center and they had just the most terrible sounds going in the pro audio department, maybe even worse than the sounds that are always coming out of the guitar department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fairly generic female singer doing some kind of singer-songwriter, almost-pop ballad stuff, but over the most obnoxious Skrillex-style American dubstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like James Blake but I just can’t imagine anything more incongruous than the blaring wub-wub with the mellow vocals, it’s like a DJ randomly mixing two records with no regard to content.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Mainstream success is super imminent</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/mainstream-success-imminent/"/>
		<updated>2015-04-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/mainstream-success-imminent/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: About a year after I posted this, we were already done, though we probably played more shows than the other Make-a-Band groups. I did, however, go on to form &lt;strong&gt;An Empty Room&lt;/strong&gt; with David the drummer, which lasted until he moved to Switzerland. I&#39;m also still in touch with the band &amp;quot;producer&amp;quot; Mike. It was, all in all, a great thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life since the move is mostly an endless series of boxes, but I have managed to get myself embroiled in one of the weirdest artistic situations of my almost 20 years of playing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d seen the Make-A-Band posters around town but hadn&#39;t really given much thought to what it even was. Erika saw an ad in the Eugene Weekly and convinced me that I was sufficiently musical and lacking in dignity to do it. So what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; it? Basically, a bunch of musicians audition for 6 producers, who pick them to form 6 bands. The bands then perform in a competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/1429200952940.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Make-A-Band Poster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers are local studio owners, record engineers, and (in the case of the ones who picked me) people in the business of video game scoring. The auditions are 3 minutes. And the competition is downtown, outdoors, for the whole damn ass world to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with Sharks, I don&#39;t feel like I ever took traditional, above-ground routes to musical performance and networking. It was always the DIY, punk rock thing — which of course in Austin is the only way anybody manages because it&#39;s a &amp;quot;who you know&amp;quot; situation and I&#39;ve rarely known anything or anybody. But regardless of how this thing turns out, I&#39;ve met some like-minded people and many of the folks making the Eugene music scene tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the band, Gravity Nocturne. We&#39;re doing a jazzy, updated take on trip-hop. We&#39;re also all like 21, except me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/gravity.nocturne-v1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gravity Nocturne&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be back to playing for nobody soon.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Smashing runs down Style Guide tools</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/smashing-style-guide-tools/"/>
		<updated>2015-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/smashing-style-guide-tools/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s amazing, looking back 9 years at what was available then. We moved from Stocco to Storybook shortly after and that&#39;s become a standard since. But in the meantime there are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many more tools, and Figma&#39;s Dev Mode just came out of beta a couple days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/13/an-in-depth-overview-of-living-style-guide-tools/&quot;&gt;Pretty good overview here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At D&amp;amp;B we started with the PHP-based Style Guide Boilerplate tool but ended up maintaining the most low-impact (but highly manual) system possible. It was a single web page. Comments in the HTML told developers where to grab pieces of markup. Not high-tech, and it required a lot of manual maintenance. But it was easy to keep it looking just like the PSD version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PAS I implemented StyleDocco using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-styledocco&quot;&gt;Grunt-StyleDocco&lt;/a&gt;. Display leaves a lot to be desired so I ended up diving into the source to modify it. I can now change the template (which is a simple Jade file) and style if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why StyleDocco? Short answer: it shows the CSS code. This was important to our developers. StyleDocco creates a new page for every Less file, splits it up by the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements in the comments, and shows those pieces alongside the HTML and samples.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>RIP to Stan Freberg</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-stan-freberg/"/>
		<updated>2015-04-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-stan-freberg/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be honest, I wasn&#39;t sure that Stan Freberg was still alive when I heard the news he&#39;d died yesterday (from Weird Al Yankovic&#39;s Instagram). But I spent a great deal of my childhood listening to him, thanks to my parents&#39; taste for vintage comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the things that played in our house — like Paul Simon or Dave Brubeck or Louis Armstrong — Spike Jones and Stan Freberg stand out. Simon&#39;s inscrutable lyrics are not something a kid can identify with. But if you&#39;re even remotely aware of &lt;em&gt;Dragnet&lt;/em&gt;, then Freberg&#39;s &amp;quot;St. George and the Dragonet&amp;quot; is a hoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe I get just a little extra sad thinking about Stan Freberg than the average celebrity death. My mind free-associates his voices and sketches with my mother. But at the end of the day, his work is &lt;em&gt;funny&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s clean, but not cheesy. It references pop culture of its time, but feels timeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/stan_freberg_show&quot;&gt;Check out the entirety of his radio show on the Internet Archive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My favorite recent mixing plugins</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/"/>
		<updated>2015-04-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The plugins I&#39;ve been using lately have changed dramatically from when I started mixing. Sometimes I&#39;m guilty of buying into hype, but I&#39;ve started to discover what I like. And I&#39;m always waiting for it to go on special...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;criteria&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Criteria &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#criteria&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes a good plugin? For me, it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;less is more&lt;/em&gt;: less options, less possibilities to twiddle, and less graphical EQ curves. Sight is a strong sense, and it can fool even an experienced ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eq&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;EQ &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#eq&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;psp-audioware-mcq&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;PSP Audioware McQ &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#psp-audioware-mcq&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 4-band plus high/low filters isn&#39;t a true analog modeler, it&#39;s a hybrid. But it sounds great, is easy to use, and doesn&#39;t hit your processor hard. So really, it&#39;s safe to put on just about everything. Its bands are hard to read (Why is it &amp;quot;.10kHz&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;100Hz&amp;quot;?), but they&#39;re highly controllable. So you can do both broad strokes and somewhat detailed surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;waves-api-560&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Waves API 560 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-api-560&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under ideal cirumstances I&#39;d have the whole Waves API 500 series bundle, but this one went on sale. It&#39;s fun to have a graphic EQ sometimes, especially one with only a few bands. It sounds great on a wide variety of sources too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;waves-scheps-76&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Waves Scheps 76 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-scheps-76&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another modeler, this one after a console. The gimmick is the integrated preamp. The bands aren&#39;t fixed on this EQ but the knobs have huge steps so you can only dial in a few possible frequencies each. The Qs are not variable. It sounds great on drums, especially kicks. Given those few bands, it&#39;s easy to crank the 60Hz and then throw one on the bass and drop the 60Hz there so they don&#39;t fight. The preamp section can add smooth overdrive to the bass as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;maag-eq4&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Maag EQ4 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#maag-eq4&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incredible EQ. It&#39;s got four fixed bands, a fixed Q, and some frankly weird frequency choices. But those bands were supposedly picked to cause the least amount of phase effects. It sounds absolutely magical. It&#39;s possible I bought into the hype with this one, but I got a deal and I can&#39;t say I feel any regret. I do feel almost guilty using it though; it requires barely any thought to make vocals, acoustic guitars, and even some drums sound amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nomad-factory-pulsetec&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Nomad Factory PulseTec &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#nomad-factory-pulsetec&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomad Factory is the Rodney Dangerfield of plugin companies. I&#39;m not sure if this thing sounds remotely like a real Pultec but it goes on all my master busses. It was completely bonkers to me at first to be able to simultaneously boost and cut the same frequencies, but man it does the trick. Not great on the top end (the Maag can handle that), but it thickens and tightens mids and low-mids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tokyo-dawn-labs-slickeq&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tokyo Dawn Labs SlickEQ &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#tokyo-dawn-labs-slickeq&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another super transparent phase-free EQ, but this one is geared toward the master buss and costs nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamics&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Dynamics &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#dynamics&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;waves-cla-76&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Waves CLA-76 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-cla-76&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited a great long while for this to go on sale. I&#39;ve always wanted an 1176 that wasn&#39;t the Bomb Factory BF76 that comes with Pro Tools. It&#39;s everything I wanted it to be and I use it everywhere — primarily drums but it&#39;ll tame a problematic source quickly and with character. At its full price, it probably still wouldn&#39;t be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;waves-renaissance-axx&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Waves Renaissance Axx &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-renaissance-axx&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many people use this thing. I mean, everyone&#39;s got the Native Power Pack, right? But Renaissance Axx is one of those tools that feels like cheating. Just slide the threshold down and watch it magically even out guitars and basses. It uses so little processor I get pretty generous slapping it on guitar tracks. I&#39;ve heard a few pros cop to using this thing and why the hell not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;t-racks-opto-compressor&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;T-Racks Opto Compressor &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#t-racks-opto-compressor&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IK Multimedia is another company that gets a lot of poop from people. But I&#39;ve had their opto compressor for a long time and it&#39;s one of my favorite tools for vocals. It can open up a weak track by an inexperienced vocalist who&#39;s all over the place or who didn&#39;t project. You can get miles of compression out of the thing with much more transparency than an 1176. Sometimes I&#39;ll double a difficult vocalist&#39;s track, overdrive it, crank the mids and highs with a smooth EQ like the Maag, and then flatten it out with this compressor. Mixing in a little bit of that adds presence and is probably a super old trick not worth mentioning. But this is a good comp to do it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tokyo-dawn-labs-kotelnikov&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Tokyo Dawn Labs Kotelnikov &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#tokyo-dawn-labs-kotelnikov&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still learning this feedback compressor, but it&#39;s smooth and transparent. You almost have to watch the meters to see that it&#39;s compressing, but it can make the master buss sound great. And though you can spring for the &amp;quot;Gentlemen&#39;s Edition&amp;quot; (?), the basic version is super great and costs zero dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ddmf-the-strip&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;DDMF The Strip &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#ddmf-the-strip&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a full channel strip so it&#39;s both and EQ and compressor, in switchable order. It has a Neve look and that&#39;s the starting point for the modeling. But this amazing plug goes a little farther into original territory than most models. DDMF is one of the few developers who can get away with charging next to nothing for plugins yet still get respect from GearSlutz. I got it for $30 as a launch special and I&#39;m crazy impressed. Even the knob motion reveals just how much thought went into this. The developer is also a mixer, and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flux-bittersweet&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Flux Bittersweet &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#flux-bittersweet&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need simple transient shaping that&#39;ll get the job done without interfering with other dynamics processing. How&#39;s one knob? How&#39;s free? It sounds nice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Cat folks make some great stuff. This is a simple but flexible plugin chainer that gives me solid performance loading VSTs or AU plugins into Pro Tools. DDMF&#39;s Metaplugin would also do the trick, probably very nicely as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these two free metering tools, I can monitor what my sound &amp;quot;looks like&amp;quot; for the low cost of free.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Solving the seven sins of CSS</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, the ReactJS community has set its sights on a new method of building styles into React-based front ends. It comes straight from the source, Facebook. Here&#39;s the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;speakerdeck-embed&quot; data-id=&quot;2e15908049bb013230960224c1b4b8bd&quot; data-ratio=&quot;1.33333333333333&quot; src=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this presentation makes a lot of sense to a lot of developers who&#39;ve begun to think in the component-based (and honestly very sensible) React methodology. But there are a lot of strange justifications and a path paved with over-engineering that leads to vjeux&#39;s ultimate solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: This is long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problems&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The &amp;quot;Problems&amp;quot; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#the-problems&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here are the problems that vjeux outlines. I&#39;m not here to provide better solutions for them, but I will say that in many cases, they&#39;re not really problems at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-global-namespace&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;1. Global Namespace &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#1-global-namespace&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I think this is key to illustrating why a developer of vjeux&#39;s caliber can have a great thought process but miss the boat to some degree on CSS. He calls a class a &amp;quot;global variable.&amp;quot; This seems at first like a matter of introducing programming semantics into the conversation so we all know what we&#39;re talking about, but I think it&#39;s conflating what a &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;variable&lt;/em&gt; actually are. The word itself indicates that the value of a variable can change — if anything, a CSS class is a constant. It&#39;s simply a pointer or reference. If you prefer, a class or ID selector is a set of rules more akin to a function (or, in OO, a &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;... probably no coincidence there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting away from a concept I honestly feel somewhat inadequately equipped to really talk about at length, the &amp;quot;namespace&amp;quot; issue itself is the first of these that isn&#39;t really an issue. A class living on its own, even one attached to an element (e.g., &lt;code&gt;div.myclass&lt;/code&gt;), does inhabit a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; namespace in the sense that you can use that class anywhere with no limitations. Only good practice will limit you. But writing self-contained rules is not incredibly hard, is it? Take this piece of LESS (roughly identical in SCSS):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.specific-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;input.super-specific-input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* style rules */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;label.super-specific-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* style rules */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sense that &lt;code&gt;.specific-container&lt;/code&gt; is available to use and abuse anywhere, it is a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; element. But that class in itself becomes an effective namespace for anything within it. And a few simple naming conventions can take that further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can barely think straight to comment on these (literally) backwards extensions that the Facebook team apparently wrote before arriving at the conclusion that they should abandon CSS altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-dependencies&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;2. Dependencies &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#2-dependencies&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not entirely sure I understood this section, mostly because the expectations of CSS working like a build process (i.e., errors should cause everything to break) is such a foreign concept to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintainability and monitoring the Cascade used to be a huge issue with CSS. This is something that preprocessors have solved incredibly well, even though they don&#39;t change many fundamental aspects of CSS. That includes the Cascade itself, but one of Less&#39;s early counterarguments was that the ability to write such modular CSS discourage &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; or &lt;em&gt;cascading&lt;/em&gt; use of styles. I&#39;m not exactly pedantic on that myself, but if one were so inclined to write completely modular Less/Sass with no globally-impacting styles and no large-scale cascading, it&#39;s not very hard to do. Basically the above example, repeated numerous times as separate files and associated with each module or UI component, &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; a set of dependencies. These are easily managed by Less/Sass imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-dead-code-elimination&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3. Dead Code Elimination &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#3-dead-code-elimination&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near as I can tell, what they&#39;re referring to as &amp;quot;dead code elimination&amp;quot; is a product of their own solution. I can&#39;t really speak to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can say is that poorly-maintained, long-running, legacy CSS (the old way, without the concatenation made possible from preprocessors) is a problem for a lot of people. This is not a fault of the language itself. Less/Sass certainly make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-minification&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;4. Minification &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#4-minification&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone can help me here, but I&#39;m confused about this one — the old, extended-CSS solution let Facebook&#39;s developers use incredibly weird, non-semantic, but very short class names in order to save a couple bytes. It&#39;s bizarre but has its logic. So how does programmatically replacing a token with a long list of inline styles — which are maintained as a single component but echoed into a page once for every instance — save bytes? Not sure. If semantic class selectors is a problem of byte size, that&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s one that huge, redundant inline styles can solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-sharing-constants&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;5. Sharing Constants &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#5-sharing-constants&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the old quote? There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things. Making your stuff sync up between content, presentation, and behavior is a problem old as the hills, but most teams don&#39;t have the specific problem in this deck because they&#39;re not working with this weird system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What vjeux shows here is a worst-of-both-worlds scenario where style has been mixed into behavior, but not all the way. I would argue that yes, in fact, his completely inline solution is a better answer than the hodgepodge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; buttonPadding &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that physically hurt me. He says &amp;quot;unfortunately there are many real world use cases where you need to do it.&amp;quot; Not sure I buy that. If you really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; feel this need, there are tools for your Grunt or Gulp file that will transform a list of Less/Sass variables into Javascript at build time and thus keep the values synced automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reading the solution they developed, I got pretty confused at &amp;quot;CSS Variables.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-non-deterministic-resolution&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;6. Non-deterministic Resolution &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#6-non-deterministic-resolution&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another case of holding CSS to the same standards of behavior as a logical programming language, which it is not. The &amp;quot;linear&amp;quot; flow of later rules overriding earlier ones is always something that programmers struggle with because they can&#39;t organize things according to how they like; &lt;strong&gt;they must organize according to how the web browser is going to read the document&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing with the modular, &amp;quot;namespaced&amp;quot; blocks of Less/Sass eases these problems in two ways: one, confining the rules to their own pocket of markup will keep them from affecting anything else in the application, and two, the ease of auditing the styles will prevent unexpected cascades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-breaking-isolation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;7. Breaking Isolation &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#7-breaking-isolation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sad for the team at Facebook who&#39;ve been burned by a poor understanding and even poorer practices of CSS writing. Overriding in the way shown in the example is unfortunate. But imagining myself as a designer in that organization, forced to think in an upside down way about my CSS, it kinda feels like it&#39;s no wonder the designers reach for non-ideal solutions as long as they &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-problems-with-the-solution&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;My Problems with the Solution &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#my-problems-with-the-solution&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can certainly see the appeal of just styling within the component as Javascript. The author does fall into a pattern that is common among devs (I&#39;ve done it too): a post-hoc justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, style is actually a much better name than class. You want to &amp;quot;style&amp;quot; the element, not &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s not bring the semantics into it — I get that the actual english &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; make more sense, but we&#39;ve all agreed on what that word means in the context of markup. This is a side point though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-redundant-bytes-and-information&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;1. Redundant bytes and information &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#1-redundant-bytes-and-information&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re talking in terms of human readability or the space taken on disk/downloaded over the internet, I have to question whether multiple references to a single CSS class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.btnClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #333&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 2px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #fff&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not preferable to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token special-attr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token value css language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;#333&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;2px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One button&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;repeated over and over throughout the application. And here of course I&#39;m using a very simple example; most real-world CSS rules are going to be &lt;em&gt;significantly larger&lt;/em&gt;. This is one of those questions that I assume has been empirically answered, but there isn&#39;t a lot of usage of this method going around yet, so I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-separation-of-concerns&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;2. Separation of Concerns &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#2-separation-of-concerns&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the very real benefits in React of mixing concerns while separating physical application pieces. Everything associated with this piece (structure, style, behavior) is in one place, so I know exactly what needs to be done in order to make a change to that piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But part of the benefit of the classic &amp;quot;separation of concerns&amp;quot; philosophy is the ability to take a holistic look at the styles. For all the supposed solutions with regard to maintenance and dead code elimination, I&#39;m afraid this has created many more potential ones. Obviously, this is to some degree going to be dependent on how a React application is structured, but components can&#39;t truly share stylistic elements, even if they have individual styles in common. So the ability to change that stylistic element from a central place is now lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best we can really do with this method is reference a central variable, or possibly (I&#39;m not even sure about this) something like a mixin. Like any of the CSS-based solutions that vjeux writes off as non-enforceable, this requires good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-separation-of-work&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3. Separation of Work &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#3-separation-of-work&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vjeux himself admits that part of the motivation for Facebook&#39;s crazed bolting on to CSS is due to having a large team of developers working on highly focused portions of code, most with limited expertise in front end. This is, let&#39;s be frank, not an uncommon problem but it is a specific one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though tools like KSS have been around for a while, style-guide-based development is just now coming into its own. Mailchimp, Starbucks, Lonely Planet and others have made huge and very public strides in building component libraries that developers can then reference and drop into new pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits are easy to see: a streamlined design process, easy enforcement of standards, and a refocused approach that encourages solving problems with the same design patterns where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all styles inside the React components, control over front end is not only not handled holistically, it is handled entirely by developers who may or may not have much expertise with browser discrepancies, best practices, and all the other myriad of things that CSS writers actually focus their time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-missing-features&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;4. Missing Features &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#4-missing-features&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generated content and other pseudo-class selectors are pretty much not available here. Is it overkill to impose a hover state just for a color? Perhaps not with React, whose bread and butter is state change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about media queries? This is beyond unfortunate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/mediaqueries.png&quot; alt=&quot;Not the best Responsive Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toward-a-better-way&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Toward a better way &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#toward-a-better-way&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all fairly new issues. vjeux&#39;s still giving this presentation, and it only went online in November. React developers are still discovering the process and trying it on. The argument on Hacker News is still somewhat active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is not with upending dominant paradigms. It&#39;s not with trying to find new ways of styling. But ditching most of the primary benefits of CSS/Less/Sass and justifying that with arguments based on some inaccurate assumptions is a paradigm shift that doesn&#39;t quite feel necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>So long, and thanks for all the Lone Star tallboys</title>

		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/so-long/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent 7 years in Pittsburgh, another in Detroit, and now just shy of 7 years I&#39;m leaving Austin. That&#39;s as lucky a number as any, although it feels like an incredibly short time in a city that grows and changes as rapidly as this one. But ultimately, the exciting stuff in this town suits young people who go out a lot, tech-libertarians, people who aren&#39;t yet sick of Texas&#39;s inability to &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; public transit, and the sort of day drinkers who&#39;ve always occupied the Town of Linklater Films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, I&#39;ll probably continue telling myself that indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s a lot of truth there — it really is tough when you have a young child to even imagine enjoying the fruits of a town known for its nightlife, and eventually you start to wonder if that&#39;s really for you anymore. As a musician, it&#39;s hard to always play for nobody or to keep pace with the younger, better looking indie-poppers filling up the increasingly snobby and hard-to-book venues. As a person who tries to have some perspective, sometimes taking a step back you realize how much &lt;strong&gt;Austin is clinging to its fun slacker persona, even as it gets big enough that it really could stand to clean up its act maybe just a little before it loses everything that people love about it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t about how &amp;quot;Austin has changed, man&amp;quot;; That was old even when I moved here. Of course places change and that&#39;s part of what makes a town ok to continue living in more than 7 years. But I&#39;m not a lone wolf slacker musician, I&#39;m now some kind of &amp;quot;family man&amp;quot; (imposter syndrome doesn&#39;t just work at your job) and that is a super rewarding part of my life that&#39;s taking me away from the both the eye-rolling mustachioed coolness I&#39;m so over and the merciless, dash-cracking sunshine I love so much. So yeah, there is a flipside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t too great at making friends until moving here. I&#39;ve become more social and worked in an office again, so I&#39;m leaving behind maybe the closest, coolest bunch of people ever — people who, I&#39;d like to think, &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not exactly headed to unstable territory now, but if I&#39;m being real it&#39;s difficult to leave behind 75-degree winters, constant restaurant openings, or that slight swell of pride when even a big city slicker&#39;s eyes brighten at the mention of where you live. It&#39;s even harder to leave those friends I&#39;ve worked with, played music with, or lived next to. Having them all gather at a party for us yesterday was beyond cool — it was downright humbling that that many people care enough (A friend called the beautiful weather &amp;quot;one last kick in the nuts&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/party.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;party&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now... It&#39;s not in the least bit hard to leave constant traffic, lines to sit in literally every one of those restaurants, or the Texas government, none of which are gonna go anywhere anytime soon. And I could do without the hypocritical faux-liberals who nod sagely about how we need affordable housing and mass transit, but then get all predictably NIMBY when it comes time to do something. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE IN 2024: OH NO EUGENE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than dwell on what great things I&#39;m leaving or bemoan the bad ones, I think it&#39;d be more productive to commit yesterday&#39;s laughs and hugs to memory, give thanks for the all that&#39;s happened to me here, and think of what other positive stuff lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&#39;m going to a culturally rich, meteorogically mild place with incredibly friendly people, and my new commute is going to add hours to my week (time) and probably years to my life (I-35 stress). But that&#39;s just the beginning. Now that I&#39;m a little better at life than I was seven years ago, my hope is that I can create an even more amazing one there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is me in the &amp;quot;Before&amp;quot; picture, look for the &amp;quot;After&amp;quot; soon. And at least check out my Instagrams from the road.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>My favorite albums of 2014</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/"/>
		<updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that it&#39;s almost February, I assume everyone has already read all the best-of-the-year lists that matter to them. So here&#39;s one that won&#39;t. These are the best records I heard that came out in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/aurora.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AURORA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ben-frost-a-u-r-o-r-a&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Ben Frost - A U R O R A &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#ben-frost-a-u-r-o-r-a&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly really didn&#39;t know anything about Ben Frost and hadn&#39;t heard his earlier stuff, but this is a magical concoction of computerized and percussion-heavy experimental electronics that takes me back to the days of playing shows with fellow laptop jockeys and industrial car-part-smashers. It&#39;s a varied, rich, and constantly surprising piece of work, and it has Thor Harris on it too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;st-vincent&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;St. Vincent &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#st-vincent&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen St. Vincent, and I&#39;ve heard pretty much all of her albums, but this was the first one to really catch my ear. This is the kind of art rock that people like Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush used to do — accessible but genuinely attempting to go places. She&#39;s also the kind of guitar player who&#39;s super talented but intriguing, not shreddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/soused.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Soused&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scott-walker-and-sunno-soused&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Scott Walker and SunnO)))  - Soused &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#scott-walker-and-sunno-soused&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Scott Walker gets increasingly prolific in his old age, it&#39;s starting to be apparent that he&#39;s actually got a pretty in-tune sense of humor. On paper, Walker with Sunn is the Lou Reed/Metallica album that actually &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. In practice, it&#39;s basically a Scott Walker album with guitars, and that&#39;s just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;swans-to-be-kind&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;SWANS - To Be Kind &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#swans-to-be-kind&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seer was maybe the peak of Gira&#39;s output, ever. It was the realization of the promise that &lt;em&gt;Swans are Dead&lt;/em&gt; teased us with just before he originally disbanded the group. The only thing wrong with &lt;em&gt;To Be Kind&lt;/em&gt; is that it&#39;s not &lt;em&gt;The Seer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sumerian-fleet-just-pressure&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sumerian Fleet - Just Pressure &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#sumerian-fleet-just-pressure&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically kind of started following Dark Entries records around the time I got super into the Minimal Wave catalog as well. That led me to their flagship release of 2014. This retro slice of Linn-driven heavy old-school EBM meets sparse synth-wave makes me think of the best of early 242, and it&#39;s immaculately produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-the-jewels-2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Run the Jewels 2 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#run-the-jewels-2&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It topped a lot of the pros&#39; lists, and it&#39;s probably obvious why. The first RTJ was a cool side project, but the real potential of an El-P/Killer Mike collaboration opened up on the second one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blxpltn-black-cop-down&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;BLXPLTN - Black Cop Down &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#blxpltn-black-cop-down&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of Austin&#39;s most exciting local bands, but they&#39;re not going to get the press that the mellower or more rockist indie groups will. They&#39;re a hardcore band with a drum pad. What a weird thing, but they&#39;re so fierce, catchy, and fist-in-the-air angry it&#39;s hard to deny the live show or the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/undercolor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Under Color of Official Right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;protomartyr-under-color-of-official-right&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Protomartyr - Under Color of Official Right &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#protomartyr-under-color-of-official-right&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Protomartyr album was kind of out of nowhere, and doing the jagged Fall-inspired post-punk thing in Detroit is unexpected. But the production is better, the songs are tighter and darker, and Joe Casey&#39;s incredible lyrics are more audible on the second one. It&#39;s a mix of a realistic portrait of alcoholic depression, a lament for Detroit, and what Casey calls &amp;quot;bad dad songs&amp;quot; (one of which, &amp;quot;Bad Advice,&amp;quot; is about Kwame). This, from &amp;quot;I Stare At Floors,&amp;quot; sums up well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The day comes&lt;br /&gt;
same as before&lt;br /&gt;
it goes on again&lt;br /&gt;
the television a concave window&lt;br /&gt;
lawyers and murderers&lt;br /&gt;
the Law&#39;s confusing, the Order makes no sense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scratching the skin&lt;br /&gt;
Staring at walls, staring at floors&lt;br /&gt;
The plan today is not to die&lt;br /&gt;
The cure-all&#39;s always over ice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to it every day for like 3 months and still can&#39;t get enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-stuff&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Other stuff &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#other-stuff&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fennesz, Aphex Twin, The Bug, FKA Twigs, and of course Shellac all put out solid albums this year that I enjoyed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;honorable-mention-from-2013&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Honorable Mention from 2013 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#honorable-mention-from-2013&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Minimal Wave, I also discovered Veronica Vasik&#39;s sub-label Cititrax and the act Kontravoid. He apparently used to be the live drummer for Crystal Castles but in any case his self-titled dark synthpop LP from 2013 got a lot of play from me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Change is what the web is about</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/"/>
		<updated>2014-12-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote this for our corporate blog. Rather than give everyone I know instructions for connecting to our VPN, I thought I&#39;d reproduce it here. The gist is: as we go through a lot of change both process-wise and philosophically, we need to make sure nobody gets too attached to one way of thinking and gets left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, the Web has undergone constant evolution. But along the way, it’s also gone through some major revolutions that left it forever changed — and left some people behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;purty-pitchers&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Purty Pitchers &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/#purty-pitchers&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first earth-shattering change was the NCSA Mosaic browser. Why? One word: graphics. &lt;em&gt;Color&lt;/em&gt; graphics! You wouldn’t think this would bother anyone: sure, they took a long time to load and were really awful quality purplish GIFs for a long time, but being able to navigate around a web page with your mouse and scrollbar really opened up the web to a lot of people who would never have touched the green-on-black terminal browser Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/mosaic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mosaic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there were casualties: the early denizens of the internet, the super tech-savvy terminal jockeys and ASCII artists who preferred the music of a ker-chunking &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard&quot;&gt;IBM Model M keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to the click of a mouse saw their little private utopia being taken away. In a way, I can sympathize. They were probably worried it’d be filled with n00bs, dads and ads eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the lesson is there. Adapt or get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-blue-beanie&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Blue Beanie &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/#the-blue-beanie&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these revolutions have happened during my career. The rise and fall of Flash, the advent of YouTube, blogging… it’s been a fun ride so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from a designer/developer standpoint, something that in hindsight might’ve had the biggest effect was the Web Standards movement. As late as the mid–2000s, we’d been designing pages based on some anonymous genius’s realization that HTML tables and weirdly sliced images could be used to create print-like layouts on web pages. Thus the business of “web design.” But this was a hack, and it helped us grow an appetite for hacks. Meanwhile, Netscape and Microsoft were vying for supremacy in the browser market by adding more and more amazing but completely incompatible features. So we essentially had to build sites twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/img/zeldman.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zeldman&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-06/jeffrey-zeldman-king-of-web-standardsbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Zeldman came along&lt;/a&gt; and told us all to try something: first off, stop using tables, because we’re hacking a useful feature of the browser to do something awful it wasn’t meant to do, and second, stop using these browsers’ non-standard features. Start using CSS. Thus the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstandards.org/&quot;&gt;Web Standards Project&lt;/a&gt; (and what has come to be called the web standards movement) was born. And this movement effectively ended those dreaded Browser Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust me, we’re all better for it. But for a while, there were a lot of designers and developers who didn’t want to abandon their fancy browser features, and didn’t want to stop using tables because &lt;em&gt;they worked!&lt;/em&gt; Those people adapted. Or they became irrelevant once the browser makers got on board with the Standards crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;responding-to-change&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Responding to Change &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/#responding-to-change&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of web applications was not about just one thing. Faster broadband, AJAX, browsers able to run complex Javascript, web fonts, SVG, and all kinds of other stuff made the web the new platform for software. It’s still getting better. And our desktop computers aren’t the only devices with these front-end capabilities anymore. If I can get my software over the web, and my phone has a really good web browser, I should be able to run the software on my phone, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan Marcotte first coined the term “Responsive Web Design” &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design&quot;&gt;four years ago on &lt;em&gt;A List Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the design world has been pretty… responsive to it. Rather than the conversations I used to have ten years ago over whether we’re going to finally support 1024x768 screens, applications can now resize, reflow, and customize for different screens and devices. It’s a huge change in a way of thinking, but it’s also one more way that web applications are now more like “real” applications: do Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop force me into a highly controlled layout that only works at a certain window size?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like the ASCII art and table layouts, there are going to be some casualties in the new way. I think the concept of “pixel perfection” is one of those. If my application changes from screen to screen and situation to situation, I can’t ever know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what it’s going to look like to any particular customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still room for all the careful and highly thought out work that we’ve always done when crafting web pages and web applications. In fact, our job is more important than ever because there’s no way a print layout designer can ever do what we do: deliver what our customers need, on whatever device they need it. And we don’t have any intention of being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tables — no longer the devil</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/tables-considered-good/"/>
		<updated>2014-11-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/tables-considered-good/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little while back, I linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://colintoh.com/blog/display-table-anti-hero&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; extolling the virtues of &lt;code&gt;display: table-cell.&lt;/code&gt; And I wholeheartedly agree. Using table display moves the Holy Grail Layout from hacky and difficult to done in a couple lines of CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the article mentions is source order. The author kind of waves this away as an SEO concern, but I&#39;d argue it&#39;s the single biggest issue holding back even the people who aren&#39;t skeeved out by the word &amp;quot;table.&amp;quot; Source order used to matter little to me; I also thought it was pretty much an SEO issue, or possibly a tweak to page rendering speed at best, but in this day and age? It&#39;s easy to move stuff horizontally with floats, but stacked boxes in a mobile layout really need the source order you want to appear on screen. Which, conveniently, is probably the most sensical source order. And if your table layout doesn&#39;t support that, you might have created some real headaches for yourself in a responsive page or screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I&#39;ve just started playing with &lt;code&gt;display:table&lt;/code&gt; in earnest on some sites and I&#39;m experiencing some strange behavior with regard to showing and hiding elements. This is further compounded by shifting breakpoints as you resize the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a couple schools of thought on that, both of which I&#39;ve belonged to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The diligent front end devs who will make sure that they&#39;ve fixed every little weird issue. This is probably the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; school to be in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pragmatic but perhaps somewhat lazy approach says &amp;quot;only designers sit and resize their browsers all day long making sure all the breakpoints work.&amp;quot; We&#39;re designing for multiple devices and screen sizes, not constantly shifting screen sizes. Probably. And the major layout shift where the bug happens is at a small enough size that you probably won&#39;t see it on desktop browser at all, where resizing is possible. Probably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing of responsive layout is that it&#39;s an admission we don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; all the cases. So knowingly leaving a weird situation in there without making a pretty significant effort to fix it is a disingenuous move. Hopefully I&#39;ll make progress on it, and if I do, I&#39;ll document it here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>(A series of grunting noises)</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/"/>
		<updated>2014-10-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve finally taken my first step into the wide world of yesterday&#39;s favorite web technology with a new understanding of Grunt. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: It wasn&#39;t long before I moved to Gulp. Welp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s par for the course that designers and front end devs are trendy, fad-prone folks with their eye to the future and an almost obsessive-compulsive desire to find the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; set of tools or processes. And by now, many (especially the ones prone to blog posts) have moved past Grunt to another Javascript/Node-based system called Gulp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being hip and with the times too — I have a Ghost blog. But having just discovered enough information about Grunt from ebooks, coworkers, and Stack Overflow threads to be dangerous, I&#39;m not about to move on just yet. And now that I &amp;quot;get it,&amp;quot; I have to say that maybe it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; kind of the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-make-grunt-resilient-in-the-long-run&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;What will make Grunt resilient in the long run? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/#what-will-make-grunt-resilient-in-the-long-run&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;perfection&amp;quot; of Grunt is not about its extreme levels of functionality, nor its user-friendliness (lol). It&#39;s the flexibility. Grunt serves that obsessive-compulsive tool-design side of front end with a lot of plugins and an easy way to write more. If you&#39;re a FED and you really need something that isn&#39;t in the Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, then maybe you should consider taking your skills to the node-module-writing level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also super portable, which makes creating an environment a snap — just install Node, and you can run Grunt-powered sites and apps. I&#39;ve heard opposing arguments on whether to put your Node modules for an app or site into Git, but right now we&#39;re not. Any new environment just needs to run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and they&#39;re up and running. It&#39;s literally that easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-doing-with-it&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;What are we doing with it? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/#what-are-we-doing-with-it&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&#39;m working on a static prototype with bootstrap (LESS version), JQuery, and a few charting libraries. Grunt moves static files from a &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; directory, minifies Javascript, compiles LESS files and Jade templates, and runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.browsersync.io/&quot;&gt;Browsersync&lt;/a&gt; for live reloading and injection. When we&#39;re all synced up, it also deploys to Amazon S3 for the stakeholders to view live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively simple setup for Grunt, which can do all kinds of more Node apps and complex whosamawhatsits. But it&#39;s the right tool for the job when compared to something like Preproc or CodeKit which, don&#39;t get me wrong, are nice apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I nailed down the file structure early and defined it in the Jade compiler. Now every new Jade template added automatically compiles to an HTML file in the right structure. CodeKit requires me to define the path of every new template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grunt also lets you create multiple setups. For instance, in development, the watcher and compiler might not minify the final Javascript and CSS so they&#39;re more easily debugged in the browser. But on deploy, minify it all. And this is all a one-time setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;downsides&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Downsides &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/#downsides&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one-time setup is pretty much Grunt&#39;s big downside. The syntax is a bit arcane to me, not quite resembling any normal Javascript or JSON files. Installing packages is a breeze with NPM, but actually setting up the tasks and getting them to do what you want can be a many-hour process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, is that worth the flexibility and other advantages it offers over simpler GUI compiler applications? Depends on your use case, I&#39;d guess. For us, it&#39;s really fantastic. I still use CodeKit on some other sites, and I&#39;m sure the daunting setup process will keep me away a few times that I might prefer using Grunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, it&#39;s been fun to learn and satisfying to set up a workflow exactly how I want. That might make me a fad-chasing Kool-Aid drinker but I&#39;m happy to never struggle with my tools not doing what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/curmudgeons/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These days, there are more &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; to the problem of music piracy than you can shake a DMCA takendown at. While I&#39;m somewhat in the Steve Albini camp of &amp;quot;we are passing the brief period of history where musicians were able to make a comfortable living,&amp;quot; what I find interesting is the side discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2014/06/30/teach-guitar-teenagers-tell-new-music?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+digitalmusicnews+%28Digital+Music+News%3A+Top+Stories%29&quot;&gt;I saw this&lt;/a&gt; the other day thanks to a RT from a musician friend. I don&#39;t believe a word of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of the comment is betting that their audience lacks exposure to youth the same way they do. Young people are a scary, alien species who don&#39;t believe in paying for music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not because they don&#39;t value music of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some claims made in the comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The girls want to learn &amp;quot;One Direction, Fall Out Boy, and a handful of sound-alikes.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;d put a lot more stock in this if the two groups mentioned actually &lt;em&gt;sounded alike&lt;/em&gt; themselves. This is where the audience&#39;s ignorance really pays off. Fall Out Boy is an American pop-punk band formed in 2001 (that&#39;s working on 15 years ago, kids) who helped bring pop-punk/pop-emo from the 90s style into the 2000s. They are highly influential and though I can&#39;t stand to listen to 5 seconds of them, you don&#39;t need a degree in Telling Death Metal Bands apart to know that they don&#39;t sound anything like One Direction, a boy group from England who don&#39;t write songs and don&#39;t really have guitar parts for these straw-students to learn. Comparing the two, at any rate, is the purview of YouTube comments, not kids who want to learn to play music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bon Jovi will never be cool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people are eating this crap up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s ignore the absolute sexist bent of the comment for a second, if that&#39;s possible, and focus on the wealth of amazing music being made by young folks (I mean really young, the Tumblr generation of bands if you will) who have no regard for any of the &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; that we have always played by, regardless of how punk we think we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Dress Well, Odd Future, Janelle Monae, Grimes, and countless other young artists (you know, of the age that popular artists tend to be) are making music that seamlessly blends genres that we&#39;d previously have considered verboten — imagine if &lt;em&gt;Paul&#39;s Boutique&lt;/em&gt; was your &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt; — and they really don&#39;t care what some guitar teacher thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Better static sites with Jade</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/"/>
		<updated>2014-08-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&#39;t used it in a while but in theory I really still like &lt;s&gt;Jade&lt;/s&gt; Pug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you&#39;ve been riding the current wave of preprocessors and static site generators, you&#39;re probably overwhelmed by the choices out there. As with musical tools, I tried to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/2014/04/16/the-enemy-of-done/&quot;&gt;take my own advice&lt;/a&gt; and pick one thing to stick to for a while, see how it goes. I happened to pick a less-popular, less-mature tool with less documentation and material out there than any other. But it&#39;s not based in Ruby, and that should make Alex happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jade was created by a 22-year-old CS undergraduate in England, and it&#39;s a super cool little pseudo-language for templates, written in Node. Unlike Ghost, which powers this blog, you don&#39;t need to get Node running on a web server to make sites with it, which can restrict your choice of web hosts. On the contrary, you run Node on your local box and generate a static site with the Jade processor, then host that bad boy pretty much anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a little bit about Jade, and if you&#39;ve used templating engines before you may find it to be pretty familiar. If not, then it&#39;s a really good starter language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-syntax&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Basic Syntax &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#basic-syntax&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick a central principle of Jade&#39;s syntax, it&#39;d be the indention-awareness. Yes, it&#39;s written in Javascript, but you won&#39;t see brackets and semicolons everywhere (which is something I think Sass has over LESS). Just indent the next line and you&#39;re nesting html or logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-class&quot;&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-class&quot;&gt;.pagetitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Page Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-id&quot;&gt;#opening-paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;This is some text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, right? &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; is an implied tag, and the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; do what you might expect if you passed CSS 101. Here&#39;s the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;pagetitle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Page Title&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;opening-paragraph&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is some text.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benefit here is that keeping tags properly nested and closed — which can be a bear when you&#39;re dealing with templates — becomes a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attributes are written as arguments, so this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token attributes&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/blog/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-custom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;val&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Blog Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;produces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/blog/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-custom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;val&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Blog Link&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a few idiosyncracies and some details, that&#39;s totally it for markup. I can&#39;t speak for all editors, but the always-wonderful Sublime Text does have syntax highlighting schemes for Jade to make life a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;variables&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Variables &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#variables&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variables are defined pretty easily — no need to set up a special block of Javascript or anything, just define it with a dash and put spaces around the &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; dogname &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Rufus&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple ways to use variables. THe most basic is to put an &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; immediately (no spaces) after an element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt; dogname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will produce &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Rufus&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is a pretty great dog name you don&#39;t hear nearly often enough. But sometimes things aren&#39;t that simple, and you need to get the variable into a string. If you know you want to produce &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;Rufus.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Rufus&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you can use a pound and curly bracket syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token attributes&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;#{dogname}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt; dogname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination of the two types of variable output gives us what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mixins-and-includes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mixins and Includes &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#mixins-and-includes&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being tired of typing opening and closing carats is a pretty good reason to use Jade to begin with, but there&#39;s a lot more power in it than saved keystrokes and easy tag closing. Like CSS preprocessors, it gives you mixins, and like server-side languages, it provides for includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Includes are so self-explanatory they&#39;re barely worth mentioning, but I&#39;ll say this: remember your indentation when you call the include. You want to make sure your HTML structure stays intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixins are reusable blocks of markup or code that can take arguments. These can be used to absolutely destroy repetitive tasks. If you&#39;re in any way familiar with programming, think of a mixin as a function. Because that&#39;s what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token mixin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;gal_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;imgurl&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;caption&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token attributes&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;images/#{imgurl}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token code&quot;&gt; caption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks a little tricky, but let&#39;s break it down.  First you define a mixin using the unsurprising keyword &amp;quot;mixin.&amp;quot; You can add arguments as well — and you will likely need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can output the arguments in both of the same ways you&#39;d use explicitly defined variables. To use the mixin, just add a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and call it, putting the arguments in parentheses much like a javascript function. Here&#39;s an example usage for the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token mixin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token name function&quot;&gt;+gal_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;my_image.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;This is an image&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which produces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;images/my_image.png&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is an image&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, right? As in this example, mixins can make short work of repetitive elements like photo gallery or portfolio images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;extends&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Extends &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#extends&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many template languages like Smarty or Django, Jade utilizes the concept of child templates and &lt;em&gt;Extends&lt;/em&gt; to make files more efficient and manageable. For instance, a website could have a &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; template and a &lt;code&gt;company-info&lt;/code&gt; page template that&#39;s based on it. Extends can go as many levels deep as you like, but a typical case for a static site might be 3 levels: &lt;em&gt;base → page type → individual page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take advantage of them, just add &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; with the URL to the base template at the beginning of your file. If you want them to really work for you, you&#39;ll want to use &lt;em&gt;Blocks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blocks&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Blocks &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#blocks&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve never used a templating system that features them, Blocks aren&#39;t immediately intuitive. But they&#39;re hugely powerful, and they&#39;re what makes Extends really work. In any given template, think of it this way: includes are static markup, but a block is something that could be variable from page to page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;include includes/header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-class&quot;&gt;.content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;block pagecontent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;include includes/footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the header and footer are includes because they&#39;re the same throughout the site. But to get a variable piece of markup or content in the &lt;code&gt;.content&lt;/code&gt; div, we use a Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on each page, tell Jade that we&#39;re extending the &lt;code&gt;base.jade&lt;/code&gt; file, and reference the same &lt;code&gt;pagecontent&lt;/code&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-pug&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;block pagecontent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;My awesome title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Hi I&#39;m writing content! It&#39;s king, I hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not rocket surgery. You can also define a default in the base template, so that in the event a given page doesn&#39;t have that block you can always fall back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-it-to-run&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Getting it to Run &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#getting-it-to-run&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this stuff work? I mentioned that it&#39;s not a back end language, so you&#39;re not going to run it on the server. It&#39;s pre-compiled into static files. Jade, like other Node-based tools, can be compiled in a number of ways. I&#39;m not planning on getting too into that, but here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node on the command line. This is the most basic. You can just compile a directory of Jade files into HTML, or have Node &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot; the directory and compile the files as you save them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gruntjs.com/&quot;&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, which can run lots of other Node-based things at the same time with a single command in the terminal, and then get packaged for a deployment environment that works the same as your development one. Unfortunately, Grunt requires a lot of up-front setup to make that single command work. There are resources out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://incident57.com/&quot;&gt;CodeKit for Mac&lt;/a&gt; (this app is really what got me into Jade. It&#39;s a bit costly but fun and also works with plenty of other pre-compiling tools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I&#39;ll outline how I put together a portfolio site using Jade and LESS. Hopefully this was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>If you can&#39;t build it all, build a strong foundation</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/"/>
		<updated>2014-07-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve researched, interviewed, put stickies on a wall, flowcharted, wireframed, and designed (mobile first, right?) to a level of total perfection and certainty, and your product or site is going to be great. You nailed it. Then you&#39;re asked to QA the beta. Where do you even begin? This thing is just wrecked. You start to wonder if anyone on the dev team even looked at your designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desginers and design teams, particularly at large companies, often struggle with their own internal process. But when it comes to working with development teams, things start to break down even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-worlds&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Different worlds &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#different-worlds&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile development is a pretty mature process, but it doesn&#39;t really account for the more holistic way that product and UX teams tend to work. To a degree, &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanuxbook.com/&quot;&gt;Lean UX&lt;/a&gt; is an effective way for design teams to mirror the agile process and create a tandem workflow, but agile dev versus whole-earth design is only part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication tools have improved as well: &lt;a href=&quot;http://invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;Invision&lt;/a&gt;, Skitch, and other visually-oriented software takes the back-and-forth out of the realm of cumbersome text documents filled with arrows, screenshots, and vague descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, who cares more about the line-height, the spacing, the animation speed, the placement of elements than you, as the designer? No one, because you know the value of what you did. Because you did it for a reason. And what&#39;s more, when those visual cues, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/topics/micro-interactions/&quot;&gt;microinteractions&lt;/a&gt;, and precise responsive changes don&#39;t come out right, it not only makes for a substandard experience, it reflects poorly on &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... it&#39;s time to own it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-mythical-creatures-needed&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;No mythical creatures needed &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#no-mythical-creatures-needed&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not more unicorn advocacy (fun fact: in the recruiting world, unicorns are called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_squirrel&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;purple squirrels&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;). The answer to all web software design problems is not &amp;quot;turn all designers into expert coders.&amp;quot; Not everyone wants to or is capable of doing it all. The chances of finding someone who does it all &lt;em&gt;really well&lt;/em&gt; are not great. And when you do, over-taxing them with all the work is not going to scale very well. The solution is to empower the team for front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that means taking advantage of one of the unicorns you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have, or hiring a dedicated FED for your design team, it&#39;s crucial to build a bridge and stop treating design and FED as two different worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ok-not-different-worlds-then&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;OK, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; different worlds then &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#ok-not-different-worlds-then&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX folks know that UX is tied to every discipline and role: Product, design, back end, IT, and even sales. But design teams are responsible for the UI portion, and nothing affects the UI in a web-based experience more than FED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does that actually mean, in a practical sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website or web based product is generally going to have a style guide, even if your shop is lost in the Stone Age. If you&#39;re rocking a more modern fashion, you may be using style tiles or a pattern library. But the key here is that your guide can&#39;t be a Photoshop file, a list of fonts, and a sprite sheet. It can&#39;t be a wiki with PNGs and descriptions. It certainly can&#39;t be a piece of paper. It has to live in its ultimate medium: the web. What is a CSS file, after all, but a style guide that actually &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I recognize that every organization is different. With some exceptions, the dedicated FED teams I&#39;ve worked with tend to be focused on the fun stuff that challenges them in the day to day: data bindings, animations, Gruntfiles (or is it Gulpfiles now?), and other fun scripting. They&#39;re worried not just about bridging the gap with you; in these Ajax-heavy times, they have to bridge the gap with the back end as well. And my guess is you&#39;re not dealing with strictly HTML/CSS folks — otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be having these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it&#39;s not good form to run onto the field, jump on the mound, and snatch the glove from the current pitcher. Reach a hand over the wall instead of throwing your designs over it. If your team or theirs is unwilling or unable to put a FED on the design squad, it&#39;s your responsibility to make it work some other way. That way is going to mean finding the person most likely to feel some investment in the style control and working with them to build your pattern library or style guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-don-t-have-that-power&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I don&#39;t have that power&amp;quot; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#i-don-t-have-that-power&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, you actually do. Every company struggles with inter-team relations and workflows. You&#39;re not unique. The problem is that Process can rarely fix those breakdowns, and companies are bad at doing things that aren&#39;t processes. But &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; are good at communicating. Only communication from the trenches that will solve these issues. It&#39;s recognizing that we&#39;re all in this together, as the people who are tasked with making the things. It&#39;s about people working together instead of blaming each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s definitely not about unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;links&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Links &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#links&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools for building interactive, live style guides and pattern libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bjankord.github.io/Style-Guide-Boilerplate/&quot;&gt;Style Guide Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; - We&#39;re using a version of this that I modified. It&#39;s simple, maintainable, flexible, and it works. It requires PHP, but if you&#39;re not up on newfangled stuff like Node then maybe your shop is better equipped for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/patternlab.io&quot;&gt;Pattern Lab&lt;/a&gt; - Currently the new hotness. This tool builds everything for you and ensures that all the &amp;quot;atomic&amp;quot; pieces are in place. Also runs on PHP, with a Node version and plenty of other unofficial ports as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidhund/styleguide-generators&quot;&gt;An overview of Pattern Library generators&lt;/a&gt; - This is a pretty comprehensive list. If you can&#39;t find something here, stop being picky or roll your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides&quot;&gt;Creating Style Guides&lt;/a&gt; on A List Apart. If you do roll your own, here&#39;s what to include.&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Harrison Mixbus first impressions</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/"/>
		<updated>2014-07-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never worked on an analog console. Sure, I&#39;ve sat with someone and suggested technical and creative engineering decisions while they operated, but the UI paradigm of a console is only useful to me because I&#39;ve used desktop mixers, and because pretty much all DAWs use some form of this paradigm. I don&#39;t have any allegiance to the old ways or the &amp;quot;sound&amp;quot; factor that usually consists of a bunch of vague assertions that analog summing is better (usually coupled with assertions that tape is better as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I do have is that drive to find the better workflow, the fastest way to creativity mixed with the ability to generate results. I also can&#39;t pass by a deal. For a $20 &amp;quot;no brainer&amp;quot; deal, it was certainly worth trying out Harrison Mixbus, even though Pro Tools is the standard and is a generally satisfying experience once you learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origins of Mixbus are interesting enough on their own: the project was born from an open source Linux DAW called &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardour.org/&quot;&gt;Ardour&lt;/a&gt;. The Harrison console company, known for their super high end consoles used on a huge amount of popular records, used the existing open codebase as a skeleton that they fleshed out with their own EQ, compression/leveling, saturation, and summing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;out-of-the-box&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Out of the box &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#out-of-the-box&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing is a minor pain due to the requirement of a JACK installation, and subsequent restart. JACK is a system-level audio router that&#39;s somewhere between Soundflower and Propellerheads&#39; ReWire. Apparently Ardour needs it to route from an audio interface to its own tracks. This means the JACK server, really a separate piece of software, has to run at the same time as Mixbus, but a side benefit is that audio can pretty easily be routed into it from other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why&#39;s that important? Well, to me it&#39;s important because Ableton handles all of my composition work, and Ableton is not that great at mixing compared with a package like Pro Tools. Unfortunately, ReWire mode in Ableton disables all the VST/AU plugins, rendering a good chunk of my instruments unusable. So I usually end up rendering audio tracks from Ableton and mixing those in PT, which is not necessarily going to get me the best results, aside from being a crappier workflow. I haven&#39;t yet gotten Mixbus controlling the transport in Ableton, but it does seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ui&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;UI &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#ui&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ardour was built originally for Linux. Thankfully, the Mac OS version does not require X11 or a Java VM. It hardly appears &amp;quot;native,&amp;quot; though. The reverse-color scheme, the Gnome-style file pickers and very Linux-y UI components are alien, distracting, and not very impressive. Keyboard shortcuts aren&#39;t intuitive either: some are borrowed from Pro Tools and that helps, but system-wide commands like Command-backtick for window switching, or even Command-W and Command-H, are nowhere to be found. Many of the commands use Option as their modifier key, which is awkward. Still, a lot of the editing functions are single-key, something that absolutely has to be the case before a DAW can even sit in the same room with Pro Tools. I suppose I could probably re-map them to their PT equivalents, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the thing you&#39;ll notice about the UI the most is the mixer. I&#39;ve written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mikepropst/grabbin-knobs-764a4c79e503&quot;&gt;skeuomorphs in audio software&lt;/a&gt; before, and it&#39;s all the same here. Harrison love to tout that they&#39;re a console maker, not a software maker, but that works both ways, and their application of a heavy, quasi-realistic mixer design has me gazing longingly at the screenshots of Ardour&#39;s relatively clean and straightforward (almost Ableton-esque) mixer. But as they&#39;ll tell you, this is a thing meant to replace an analog mixer, and the affordances (in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html&quot;&gt;Norman sense&lt;/a&gt;) offered by the skeuomorphs help the special features come forward. In a way, it seems like they&#39;re intentionally reaching backward, and you can feel it when you mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fast-access&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Fast Access &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#fast-access&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, there&#39;s the impressive list of built-in elements on every channel strip, and I admit this is something that I&#39;d probably miss if I were coming from the console world. I&#39;m already enjoying them. In a typical DAW, pretty much everything, with the exception of EQ in some cases, is a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Mixbus, we get a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input gain independent of the fader or the clip gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 3-band parametric EQ plus high-pass filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A compressor with three ratio types, speed control, and makeup gain. The threshold control and gain reduction meter sit right next to the fader and level meter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of parameters from the selected insert plugin on the channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the 4 mix busses and one master bus, there are tape saturators and different compressors tuned for the purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the master bus, a phase alignment meter and &amp;quot;K-meter&amp;quot; to measure perceived loudness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all of this accomplishes is a mix process that involves far less instantiation of plugins, far less opening of separate windows, and a workflow that keeps you looking at the mixer and maintaining a holistic picture of the mix most of the time. This is of course Harrison&#39;s goal, and I think they&#39;ve met it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major downside to this mixer is that there are only 4 &amp;quot;mix busses.&amp;quot; You can add any number of busses for reverbs and other effects, but only the mix busses have delay compensation. That means a lot of multiple-bus tricks that analog and PT users employ, such as parallel compression, are out of the picture due to the phasing that&#39;ll happen without delay compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-how-does-it-sound&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;But how does it sound &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#but-how-does-it-sound&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I admit to knowing little about the console world. I&#39;ve never wired one, and my understanding of routing and bussing comes largely from years of Pro Tools. Mixbus mirrors the real thing even more closely than PT, which provides both benefits and limitations (as with the limited mix busses). So what does it do for the sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I&#39;ve been impressed so far. But I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s the much-touted Harrison summing engine or whether the availability of the tools has let me get a good mix faster. Having EQs out front is important because you&#39;re tempted to use them. And most tracks are really going to need at least a little, but that tiny thought that pops up when you add a plugin creates enough of a barrier that you might skip it. And when you do add a plugin, it&#39;s probably going to have quite a few bands, and a distracting graphical display that makes you think you&#39;re doing something right because the curve &amp;quot;looks good&amp;quot; even though you might need more or less on a given band. Mixbus&#39;s basic EQ has two shelves and a bandpass that work in limited ranges, a Q that varies based on the amount of boost/cut, and a high-pass. Simple. No controllable Q, no ability to put all 3 bands in the high frequencies and create an insanely hyper-tweaked situation. Of course you can still do all that with the same plugins you know and love now, but you can get a really good mix just by carving each channel as necessary and then applying little touches of the onboard compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Performance &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#performance&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are some problems on the performance front. I was able to do some very quick mixes efficiently that sounded great without a lot of hassle, but with tunes that had about 6 tracks and not a lot of plugins (thankfully, you don&#39;t need as many plugins with Harrison). But when a client delivered me some songs with 27+ tracks to mix, it died pretty quickly. The meters don&#39;t respond, moving knobs and faders ceases to really do anything — the latency all around just gets ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;side-by-side&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Side by Side? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#side-by-side&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, Pro Tools still has a lot going for it. I find myself doing a lot of wild and (IMO) creative stuff in PT when it comes to routing and bussing, stuff you just wouldn&#39;t be able to do with an analog console — or a DAW that mirrors one too closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though I don&#39;t do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of MIDI work inside PT, I definitely have done some, and it&#39;s good to know it&#39;s there. I can add a nice synth to a track without going crazy routing multiple programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixbus also has some good editing tools, some of which are minor UI innovations and others of which are cribbed from PT, but PT is a much faster and more powerful editing machine. It&#39;s also one that I know already whereas I&#39;ve played with Mixbus for about 3 days. I&#39;ve no doubt I could get pretty handy with the flexible editing functions in Mixbus as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it&#39;s a great mixer, competent editor, and it sounds very good with no supplemental software. If you&#39;re looking to make great sounding tracks for a lot cheaper than Pro Tools and don&#39;t need MIDI functionality beyond sync, it&#39;s a really compelling tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtL1SAmjANxmLD_mILAx3Zg&quot;&gt;Harrison&#39;s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to get started playing with real practical functionality within a few minutes. The videos are short and informative, and even have some helpful general mix tips.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Diego Stocco&#39;s Rhythmic Processing</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/stocco-rhythmic-processing/"/>
		<updated>2014-06-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/stocco-rhythmic-processing/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Diego Stocco is an Italian sound designer who&#39;s worked with, among others, Hans Zimmer. He&#39;s perfected a fairly interesting technique of processing sound sources with some rhythm into multiple tracks of kick-snares, bass, and clattering beat-repeaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently he started selling his secret sauce in the form of some impulse responses for convolution reverbs as well as a $10 instructional video, &lt;em&gt;Rhythmic Processing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&#39;d try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/siAfTrUsCJ4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic premise of this short (under 10 minutes) video is that Stocco plays a rhythm with a chopstick on an acoustic guitar, then walks you through his Ableton Live effects chains to show how he turns the whole thing into a massive beat with tons of variations and atmospheric textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you&#39;ll notice is that he&#39;s efficient — this thing requires a lot of pausing to look at the settings of the plugins. That&#39;s fine, I&#39;m sick of overly long YouTube tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His method is basically to take the sound and split it, using EQs and filters, into multiple bands on multiple return channels in Ableton. This is a technique I&#39;ve used in Pro Tools for complex &amp;quot;fixing&amp;quot; on already-mixed sources (I don&#39;t have any dedicated multiband processors), but as a creative exercise it&#39;s pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocco doesn&#39;t prescribe any particular plugins. However, non-advanced Ableton users may balk at the fact that a couple of the plugs he relies very heavily upon cost money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, free sequenced gates out there for VST and AU, as well as a few &amp;quot;trance gates&amp;quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library/&quot;&gt;NI User Library&lt;/a&gt; if you&#39;re into Reaktor. For the ultimate no-cost sequenced gate, just place a standard Ableton gate effect in place of Stocco&#39;s plugin and feed a sequenced percussive sound into the side chain. Not tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it worth $10? Well, it&#39;s nothing that someone else might not be able to show you, but Stocco is known for this stuff and it&#39;s worth a glimpse under the hood. The video is very short, and that may put some people off, but it&#39;s very dense in information. I felt pretty inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The enemy of done</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/enemy-of-done/"/>
		<updated>2014-04-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://mikepropst.com/blog/enemy-of-done/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ve heard, at some point, some wizened sage say a thing about how limitations are helpful when it comes to creative endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably it was someone like Frank Zappa who didn&#39;t practice what they preached, but this isn&#39;t just &amp;quot;good for you&amp;quot; advice; it can be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What simplification means in a creative sense can be up to you: it could mean limited tools, a smaller palette, a shortened time frame, or really impractical and artificial constraints meant to &amp;quot;get the juices flowing&amp;quot; (e.g., I&#39;m only going to use MS Paint or build a song with presets from early 90s synths). But as an exercise, it&#39;s one thing; adopting simplicity as a &lt;em&gt;way of working&lt;/em&gt; is a freeing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a some great frustration playing in a large band with intricate arrangments, I decided to simplify my musical existence by going back to a one-man show for a while. But that tends to be a rabbit hole for me. I love choices and hate limitations. I don&#39;t necessarily feel like I need to use my whole toolkit in every project, but I want to know I can start anywhere. The problem often &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in starting, though. A limited palette can make that easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve created a much smaller subset of tools: two sampled analog drum kits, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_keys/&quot;&gt;Volca Keys&lt;/a&gt;, a &#39;73 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/sh1000.php&quot;&gt;Roland SH-1000&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library/entry/show/7777/&quot;&gt;Reaktor-based Minimoog emulator&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://meeblip.com/&quot;&gt;MeeBlip SE&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a kind of weird hybrid of real and simulated analog, and it&#39;s all &lt;em&gt;really cheap&lt;/em&gt;. It also feels like a pretty wide sonic palette right off the bat, but I do need &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of variety because I tend to write synth lines based on the qualities of a particular sound. The Minimoog has enough variety to spark something unique, but picking from two drum kits means I&#39;m laying down a beat in 5 minutes instead of auditioning sounds and building kits for 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I wrote a complete song during the baby&#39;s nap time. A couple hours and everything was done. Beat, bass, lead line, effects, tricks, vocals. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-nice-side-effect&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;A nice side effect &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/enemy-of-done/#a-nice-side-effect&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I discovered from going limited is that simplicity isn&#39;t the only benefit — the &lt;em&gt;inability to achieve perfection&lt;/em&gt; has opened my mind quite a bit. I&#39;ve kept the SH-1000 out of my sets for anything other than some noisy filter effects because it&#39;s monophonic, hard to play, hard to keep in tune, and doesn&#39;t have MIDI or the ability to save sounds. With Ableton, I don&#39;t need MIDI or patches: as long as I can adequately play a loop one or two times through, I have a bass or lead line recorded as audio. The key here is &lt;em&gt;adequate&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s not going to be perfectly synced, and even if I played it perfectly it wouldn&#39;t necessarily register with the 40-year-old raggedy-ass keys and the tuning would still be wonky. The Volca&#39;s similar: it can be synced to MIDI, but it can&#39;t save sounds either and the tuning tends toward unpredictability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this stuff means my music isn&#39;t perfect. But it&#39;s also got some character as a result. Aside from how you feel about tweaking sounds or cutting loops precisely, whether these things improve your music, there&#39;s one thing you can&#39;t argue with: I finished something. Quite a few somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a saying that &amp;quot;good is the enemy of great.&amp;quot; That&#39;s true, and you should always keep your standards high and your goals lofty — but remember also that &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; is the enemy of &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Tweakin&#39;</title>
		<link href="http://mikepropst.com/blog/tweakin/"/>
		<updated>2014-04-11T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I often wonder what the intersection of my two primary interests — UX and music — might be. Unfortunately, it usually seems like the main manifestation of this is in the obsessive tweaking of processes and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s probably natural for UX designers of a certain experience level to engage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/tweakin/uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/03/why-ux-professionals-should-care-about-service-design.php&quot;&gt;service design&lt;/a&gt; thinking. You eventually start to think about the holistic world rather than just the point where a customer touches a software interface. But then again, it could very well be that the obsessive desire to have the perfect experience yourself is the driver of that kind of thinking. It&#39;s a chicken and egg situation, but whichever came first with me, my point is this: I&#39;m constantly editing my tool chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer may very well be in simplicity (more on that at another time), and it definitely lies in &lt;em&gt;compromise.&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;m just not sure there&#39;s a really perfect process. Transparent tools that don&#39;t make you think are pretty much the ideal for creatives — for instance, in a live situation, tools that keep you from touching the laptop trackpad. That&#39;s why I bought an Akai APC40 controller for Ableton on Craigslist, but of course I still have to open new files, and that&#39;s a source of inaccuracy and anxiety onstage. So I&#39;ve been trying to crack that nut. The quest continues. And in the meantime, I use the hardware equivalent of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill&quot;&gt;polyfill&lt;/a&gt;, something that a layman might call &amp;quot;a trackball on stage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same in the studio.&lt;/strong&gt; My best purchase of the past year was not a plugin or piece of hardware but a set of $10 keyboard shortcut stickers for Pro Tools. It eased my learning and enabled me to work much faster, especially in the editing stage of a mix. The up-front setup (about an hour peeling and sticking these little nightmare labels), analogous to say, setting up a new project management software, made every subsequent day a little easier. Until I ruined the keyboard with a beer spill. Don&#39;t drink and mix, kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same with design.&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikepropst.com/blog/tweakin/www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; and ended up buying it because of the insane speed it offered me in a few key areas after just a short learning curve. The paradigm shift is just different enough that it mirrors Ableton: a program that is indeed a DAW and has mixer sliders but requires a completely different thought process from the old-school Pro Tools/Cubase mentality. Sketch is definitely a design tool, but it&#39;s been honed and trimmed back to incorporate only the elements you need for the particular type of design you&#39;re doing; in this case, it&#39;s screen design. But... there are holes. It doesn&#39;t do bitmaps at all, I mean &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, even compared to Illustrator. so I lose the valuable hybrid &amp;quot;don&#39;t think about the vector/bitmap divide&amp;quot; approach of the otherwise-clunky Fireworks. Which means that again, my process is incomplete and I have to fill in the gaps with workarounds and additional tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s the answer? I don&#39;t think there is one. If I rewrote this post next year, I&#39;d be talking about different tools but it&#39;d look remarkably similar. At some point you have to settle for &amp;quot;good enough it&#39;s not in my way,&amp;quot; but it&#39;s still worths striving for the zen happy place of &amp;quot;perfection.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Equals</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always liked to trace the origins of musical artists and their tunes. It&#39;s probably one of my nerdiest hobbies -- I can&#39;t really come down on anyone who memorizes worthless sports stats because I know which Current 93 record Steve Ignorant of Crass sings on and the years each of Neil Diamond&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Hot August Night&lt;/em&gt; live albums were released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a lot harder before the internet; most information came in the form of serendipity when a recognized name cropped up in liner notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the advent of the web and standardized sources of info, it&#39;s easy to trace origins. But sometimes because there aren&#39;t any liner notes anymore (if you&#39;re buying mp3s or streaming), little tidbits and cover songs can slip through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the case with The Equals: I hadn&#39;t heard of them but when I heard a loud &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhKd1Vzr-YQ&quot;&gt;glam-rock stomper&lt;/a&gt; by them on KOOP, I looked into it. Not only was the singer Eddy Grant the guy who lodged &amp;quot;Electric Avenue&amp;quot; in our collective brains, they had a pretty solid influence on the Clash. Here&#39;s the original version of another ahead-of-its-time song &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hHUdW1N3v8&quot;&gt;the Clash did a great job with&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Police on My Back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/DH0Guwo_ky0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess as long as there&#39;s music out there, it&#39;s possible to be surprised every once in a while still. Thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Uh Oh</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new blog again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly tried Octopress, a variation on Jekyll that generates a static-file blog. It&#39;s the bees knees in principle but I just can&#39;t make all the Ruby dependencies work. I&#39;ve gotten into a lot of compiled web technologies lately; it&#39;s mostly Node-based stuff like LESS, Jade, etc., but this made me feel a little like an idiot. At the end of the day I&#39;m a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really into the idea of Tumblr in some ways — namely speed, ease, and price — but the whole concept of being hosted by one of the big guys has started to get a little weird in the wake of Snowden, and I&#39;m actually looking to do something a little more high-touch than just &amp;quot;Reblog this&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;click the bookmarklet here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the rise of cheap clouds like Digital Ocean have enabled a lot of flexibility for someone with some general tech knowledge (but not enough to use a Ruby-generated static site with Github for &amp;quot;blogging anywhere&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m trying out &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is just not an option anymore, because it&#39;s an awful, heavy, security-hole-ridden mess that is fine for pushing on a client with a shared hosting environment but if you just wanna blog? not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think my friends who watch my blog are pretty much limited to &amp;quot;the ones using Tumblr also&amp;quot;, so I can&#39;t say whether moving away from it is a plus or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll probably make my own theme before too long, but I don&#39;t really know Handlebars and such, so right now this one&#39;s pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate... Off I go.&lt;/p&gt;
