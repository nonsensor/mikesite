She'd say he couldn't sing, I'd say it didn't matter because he was more of a writer. He was respected by the greats, not just the singers who sang his songs, but to other renowned writers like Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. He couldn't really act either, though he probably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KulkHZIEuIc\">edged out Willie in that regard</a>.</p>\n<p>What a lot of folks are remembering him for right now though, since <strong>Sinead O'Connor</strong>'s death is still fairly fresh, is his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/arts/music/kris-kristofferson-sinead-oconnor.html\">defending her when nobody else would</a>. Maybe it's problematic to remember such a fierce feminist with an event like th is (&quot;I didn't need a man to rescue me,&quot; she later said, though she was indeed shaken). But it's a great way to remember a good ol' boy who — like Willie — often defied stereotypes.</p>\n",

Sometimes Van Gogh gets blamed for it and maybe that's not without merit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What am I in most people's eyes? A nonentity, or an eccentric and disagreeable man -somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short, the lowest of the low.</p>\n<p>All right, then — even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.</p>\n<p>This is my ambition, which is, in spite of everything, founded less on anger than on love, more on serenity than on passion.</p>\n<p>Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven toward these things with an irresistible force.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess at least he had the opportunity to achieve that calm and harmony, though he was by most accounts not wealthy or even comfortable. Modern life should afford more of this than the early industrial revolution, but we're spending our technological efforts teaching computers to paint the sunflowers instead of ourselves. Yes, I'm still ranting about that, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-25/microsoft-three-mile-island-deal-isn-t-a-nuclear-renaissance-at-least-not-yet\">shit like this</a> is not gonna make me stop anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Also: I think the piece about love vs anger is important: it's lost so often because he's still thought of as &quot;disagreeable.&quot;</p>\n",

When artists and celebrities are on social media sites and talk so directly to their fans as she does, it exacerbates the <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parasocial-relationships\">parasocial</a> feelings that some fans already have, which were probably initiated by the unique and sometimes explicitly confessional aspects of her music and lyrics. But how else to communicate that she is indeed a person and wants to be treated as one? Hard to unravel. it's similar to Eilish's dilemma about sexualization: how to feel positive about people praising her baggy clothes when she feels there's an element of slut-shaming to it?</p>\n<p>Of course there are always the commenters and even music writers who'll say that she knew what she was getting into, that this is fame. But fame these days is a different beast, and you're gonna get it from all sides if you're a young woman (from the girls your music is aimed at because you spoke so directly to them, and from men because uhhh we're creeps). Despite being discovered on YouTube, Roan seems like a pop star who belongs in a pre-social-media era, when her stage name could've been the only thing people knew about her. But in the 2020s, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSLZFdqwh7E\">Stan</a> isn't even an outlier anymore.</p>\n<p>I don't really have a point, not sure I even have an opinion, but I do feel for these young women. Sure, they wanted fame, but for an artist that usually means &quot;sharing the stuff I make with people,&quot; not sharing their entire existence.</p>\n",

Well, some of the process of implementing a &quot;homelab&quot; is straightforward and some of it is even easy — but none of it comes without <em>escalation</em>. And my latest, as we moved into a new house, was to implement Unraid on a new machine.</p>\n<p>The benefit of Unraid is that it allows you to mix and match as many drive sizes as you want, which to my ears means &quot;you have the ability to fill your bays with whatever crap you have lying around.&quot; It maintains what's called parity, and this allows swapping of drives even in situations where RAID arrays might make it difficult. I don't know a ton about this stuff, but I know that it's got a great UI, some best practices for security, and a built-in Docker manager.

      "content_html": "<p>Apparently I'm only inspired to write when someone dies? But this is a tough one. Steve Albini was a guy who affected me musically long before I heard <strong>Big Black</strong>, though that was a truly formative experience for me as a musician and a music nerd.</p>\n<p>He of course recorded <strong>Nirvana</strong> for <em>In Utero</em> and was famously rebuffed by their major label. He then recorded the jillion-selling &quot;Nirvana with the punk rock all sanded off&quot; <strong>Bush</strong>, who were inspired by <em>In Utero</em> in the same way that Kurt and Krist were inspired by the <strong>Pixies'</strong> <em>Surfer Rosa</em> and <em>Pod</em> by <strong>The Breeders.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"big-black\" tabindex=\"-1\">Big Black <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#big-black\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>But it was the first spin of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXnMAEbYPWA\">&quot;Steelworker&quot;</a> from the debut <em>Lungs</em> that really did it for me. Not only was this a song that used a drum machine with heavy guitars <em>years</em> before Godflesh's debut or Ministry's pivot to metal, but lyrically it was a marvel. He was clearly inhabiting a character. But rather than a purely sympathetic view of a blue-collar man or a portrait of a hillbilly as racist and ignorant, it was a multi-dimensional piece of writing that really got under my skin (much like the &quot;great big thing crawling all over me&quot;). I ate up the rest of the discography, though I got into <strong>Shellac</strong> a good bit later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recording\" tabindex=\"-1\">Recording <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#recording\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In the subsequent years, I found a Steve Albini recording credit to be the mark of a certain type of band or artist. Whether it's <strong>Joanna Newsom</strong> or <strong>Sunn O)))</strong>, if you seek him out there are certain things you're looking for, and most of all it's probably a punk-informed dedicationt to making a band &quot;sound like they sound.&quot; No tricks, no double-tracking, minimal overdubs — he even eschewed compression most of the time in favor of the full dynamic range of the amps and drums sitting in his studio's mud-brick rooms. As much as he'd deny it, there is a sound to his records, but it's primarily that sound of Electrical Audio and its walls, not of a producer imposing an aesthetic on bands.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-better\" tabindex=\"-1\">Becoming better <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#becoming-better\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One thing most people knew about Steve Albini, a perception that he had a hard time changing, is that he was a prickly, opinionated individual with a knack for trash talk. This, combined with the, uh, boundary-pushing nature of a lot of his musical and related output (see both &quot;Rapeman&quot; as a band name and the <em>Forced Exposure</em> articles that are getting him gotcha-branded posthumously, accusations I'm not really gonna take seriously), made him the perfect candidate for the project that he undertook in the last few years: <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/steve-albini-counsel-culture-interview\">reckoning with his past as an OG edgelord</a>. I think it's reasonable to say that he provides a good example for anyone who really feels punk rock values but may have gotten caught up at one time or another in the more &quot;fuck you, mom&quot; aspects of punk culture, and a template for living with principles. Bonus, it's a template for all dudes, white people, and cis people who might've thought that they could get away with certain stuff because of the way they feel in their hearts or whatever. In a <a href=\"http://vishkhanna.com/2015/11/12/ep-223-ian-mackaye-steve-albini-part-i/\">dual interview with Vish Khanna</a>, he comes down on Ian Mackaye of all people for falling into the trap of thinking that punk rock shouldn't be &quot;PC,&quot; by defining &quot;PC&quot; as pretty simply as conservative rebranding of &quot;not being an asshole.&quot;</p>\n<h2 id=\"giving\" tabindex=\"-1\">Giving <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/a-world-without-steve-albini/#giving\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Albini seems to have been quite generous. He spent the last twenty years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-i-havent-had-a-conventional-christmas-in-20-years_b_8614568?utm_hp_ref=impact&amp;ir=Impact\">raising money and personally delivering needed presents</a> for the most down-and-out Chicagoans on Christmas. And he regularly shared his knowledge of making records, trying very hard to be practical and demystify not just his, but all practices of recording sound. Not just in expensive meet-the-masters type courses, but in countless freely available videos on YouTube.</p>\n<p>All of this adds up to a person I felt I could be inspired by, and who was loved by most people who knew him. It's going to be a strange world without him.</p>\n",

He had two of the best drummers in the business at the same time. Purdie is best known for &quot;The Purdie Shuffle,&quot; a basic beat with very little actual shuffle or swing but an insane amount of variable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_note#Percussion\">ghost notes</a> that give it incredible funk. Stubblefield had his own magic, and thanks to a track that got released as &quot;The Funky Drummer,&quot; he became the single most sampled drummer in history. The only break that comes close to Funky Drummer's ubiquity is the Amen Break.</p>\n<p>I think what both of these guys taught me I applied to drum programming more than acoustic drumming: Swing is an artificial way of humanizing a drum machine, but you can create an intense groove in the manipulation of dynamics (that is, volume) of the different hits. Here's about 8 minutes of only the most famous samples of Funky Drummer.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKB2N_Fyyh8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"tony-allen-africa-70\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tony Allen (Africa 70) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#tony-allen-africa-70\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"afrobeat\" tabindex=\"-1\">Afrobeat <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#afrobeat\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I said when Tony Allen died that the title for &quot;Best drummer on earth&quot; is now up for grabs. Not sure who claimed it. Allen did a lot of things, dabbling in everything from jazz to dub, but he's best known as <strong>Fela Kuti</strong>'s drummer and the innovator behind the Afrobeat. Not the genre, but the beat itself. It's hard to pin down, but for me it's also hard to stop listening to. He's never ever doing a straight beat, but somehow your head can't stop nodding. His discography is massive. There's solo stuff, Fela, even <strong>The Good, The Bad, and the Queen</strong> with <strong>Blur</strong>/<strong>Gorillaz</strong>'s Damon Albarn and Paul Simonon from <strong>the Clash</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kisTH3SFegc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<h2 id=\"jaki-liebezeidt-can\" tabindex=\"-1\">Jaki Liebezeidt (Can) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#jaki-liebezeidt-can\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-do-you-even-call-this\" tabindex=\"-1\">What do you even call this? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/groove/#what-do-you-even-call-this\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The idea that you can listen a single rhythm literally forever and not get bored was introduced to me by <strong>Can</strong>. James Brown and Fela Kuti could groove for a long time, but nothing compares to the 18-minute album version of &quot;Hallelulwah&quot; from <em>Tago Mago</em> — let alone some of the live versions that last even longer.

      "content_html": "<p>If you've ever spoken to an electronic musician or a guitarist, you know that GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) is a chronic disease. And though it can be treated, the results tend to be temporary.</p>\n<p>The issue, aside from the obvious financial ones, is that gear can never actually solve your problems. That's what all the pros say, anyway, but who can trust them? They have really nice gear.</p>\n<p>The <em>real</em> issue, at least as I see it, is that so few pieces of electronic music equipment can be compared in an apples-to-apples sort of way. Guitars? Sure. Tone-chasing is a thing, and a neurosis that's even worse than GAS, because it can cause you to hoard dozens of distortion pedals, claiming they all do different things. But are they all objectively distortion pedals? Yes.</p>\n<p>Are a Roland SP-404MKII, an Akai MPC, a Novation Circuit Rhythm, a Korg Electribe Sampler, a Polyend Tracker, and an Elektron Octatrack objectively the same thing? <em>Sort of</em>. They are samplers with sequencing. Most are capable of sequencing external machines via MIDI. Most store samples on an SD card. But it stops there. They range from around $350 to about $1500, and that's not just the honorable Swedish pedigree that's giving Octatrack that kind of price tag. They have varying amounts and quality levels of built-in sounds. There are wide ranges in connectivity and numbers of tracks. Some are more sequencers with sampling capability, others are samplers with just enough sequencing to make you think it's an all-in-one device. Some are very good at both. Some have no screens, some are basically computers in a box. You get the idea.</p>\n<p>So, in a live set, to replace Circuit Rhythm and Circuit Tracks with an <strong>MPC One</strong> is more or less an even trade in terms of whether the same stuff I've been doing is possible. But what <em>else</em> is possible? Turns out, a great deal. More on that another time.</p>\n<p>Am I going back on <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/\">what I say in this post</a> by replacing the Circuits as the centerpiece of live work? Not really, because I'm not thinking of it as an &quot;upgrade.&quot; I still think that they are the most beautiful, elegant, and <em>fun</em> quick-composition machines out there, especially the Tracks. But that's not to say that another device doesn't have a place in my show or in my life.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>A former coworker from the blog era was complaining about WordPress recently and it made me think of the bad old days, as WP was getting further and further from god's light, when I struggled more and more with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-wordpress-problem\" tabindex=\"-1\">The WordPress problem <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#the-wordpress-problem\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I don't like that, as a front-end developer (mostly in the &quot;HTML and CSS&quot; sense, too, not the front end we have today with JavaScript pulling all the weight of applications), I can't really make a WordPress theme. There are ways, such as <a href=\"https://upstatement.com/timber/\">Timber</a>, to make that happen more easily, but that's yet another dependency and more weight added to an already heavy platform.</p>\n<p>That's why I initially moved to <a href=\"https://getkirby.com/\">Kirby</a>. I think it's tempting when you've used something like Twig to want to have a templating language layer on top of things, but the truth is that Kirby (and <a href=\"https://processwire.com/\">Processwire</a>, another CMS I've replaced WP sites with) is incredibly simple and doesn't require actual &quot;PHP Coding.&quot; We're talking maybe a bit of logic now and again, but in general the functions are handled by an API that is pretty easy to use. Not to mention that both support the idea of defining your types of content, as opposed to having to bolt on yet more plugins to get custom content types and attributes to go with them.</p>\n<p>The reason for all this adding on of functionality that resembles Legos a lot less than it looks like a technological shanty town is that <em>WordPress was built for blogs</em>. And yet!! Even running a simple blog is now handled more easily by other tools like <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-static\" tabindex=\"-1\">Going static <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#going-static\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So here I am, and it's been about a year and a half since I changed engines again, this time to the static generator <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>. One thing you really don't get out of the box with a static site generator is the CMS. But what you <em>do</em> get is your Markdown editor of choice. On Mac, that is of course still <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/thanks-byword/\">Byword</a>, and on Linux it is currently the lovely <a href=\"https://github.com/brrd/abricotine\">Abricotine</a>, but the repo was archived sometime in the fall so we'll see.</p>\n<p>So how does it actually work?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-tools\" tabindex=\"-1\">The tools <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#the-tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here are the requirements in terms of tools and platforms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Eleventy (the Node script that builds a static site from Markdown files)</li>\n<li>Github (for storing the site files, accessing them from anywhere, and controlling deployment)</li>\n<li>Netlify with a free plan (for hosting and publishing)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a few requirements on the computer side:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Node (easily installed via <code>apt</code> on Debian or <code>homebrew</code> on Mac)</li>\n<li>Git (or a GUI Git client, which is what I prefer)</li>\n<li>An editor (even Textedit will do, but why not use a nice one?)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But once you install Node, all the other stuff that's needed is stored in the repository itself. Using the simplest boilerplate and reading the docs for a few minutes was all it took for me to make the simple Nunjucks templates required to make a site run efficiently. It could certainly do even more than a blog, but without a CMS interface I wouldn't give it to a freelance client or anything like that (which is where headless CMSes come in).</p>\n<p>But for the marginally tech-inclined, it's pretty easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-do-it\" tabindex=\"-1\">How I do it <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#how-i-do-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So what about actually writing?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure the repo is up to date on the local machine using Git.</li>\n<li>Create a new text file in your editor of choice.</li>\n<li>Add the YAML. Posts in Eleventy are configured using YAML at the top of the document, something that is more and more common these days. All the popular static site makers like Gatsby, Jekyll, and Hugo use it, as do flat-file CMSes like Kirby or Grav. It's not too hard to remember the format, but I use Espanso to store it as a shortcut. You could use TextExpander, aText, or whatever you like here, but Espanso works on both Mac and Linux for zero dollars so I'm into it.</li>\n<li>Run the Eleventy local server to see your work. It's a quick Node command and you get a really nice lightweight web server that runs your site locally. Every time you save a file, it automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes the browser.</li>\n<li>Check in and push to Git. That's it. Netlify handles the rest, and in a few seconds your site is ready. It's faster and easier than using FTP to update a static site. Images are the only potential problem as binaries can be slow to upload in Git, but I haven't encountered issues yet. We're talking about images on a website, not extremely large files.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"however\" tabindex=\"-1\">However <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/how-this-all-works/#however\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Is any of this really easier than WordPress or Ghost or whatever? I dunno. It's free, I know that. It lets me write in a nice text or Markdown editor, which I honestly feel more than a web interface or tool like MarsEdit. <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/\">I've been doing this kind of thing a long time.</a> It makes me feel a bit like a wizard. Plus, it hearkens back to an older, more interesting version of the internet that I used to spend time on before it became the engine that powers the most destructive form of capitalism we've probably ever seen. I guess that counts for something.</p>\n<p>Time to go write my next post in Vim.</p>\n",

He had a dream of being a cartoonist, and felt that the hippies around him in '68 were trend-following egoists rather than true free spirits. Can, however, were a different story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everybody in the band is quite special. And they had different interests in music. Jaki was free jazz, Irmin [Schmidt] was a conductor of an orchestra, Holger [worked with] Stockhausen and Michael [Karoli] was a young rock guitarist. And I was a hippie! So five totally different people with five different directions. With the chemistry, naturally it came together. That’s why it’s quite timeless music.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He left after three stone-cold, monumentally influential and still-relevant albums at 23 to become a Jehovah's Witness. But it seems like it was a pattern for him to not be a joiner, and though he considered himself a Christian until he died, he left that organization after a couple years as well.</p>\n<p>He spent a lot of time touring with random musicians and not rehearsing, preferring spontaneity — and getting away with such insanity because he was Damo Suzuki. I was lucky enough to see him around 20 years ago with a Boston band called Cul de Sac and he was still a magical performer.</p>\n<p>Safe journeys to wherever you're going now, Damo.</p>\n",

What Mann and others who jumped on the train might not have really grasped is that David Allen (not <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sherman-hemsley-prog-rock/\">the guy from Gong</a>) designed it for executives with assistants and both the time and power to lock themselves away for effectively days at a time while they did weekly reviews. The book came with a door hanger. Imagine your kid respecting a door hanger that says &quot;Weekly review in progress.&quot;</p>\n<p>Lately, I've been working with two systems that are more geared toward creative minds: the bullet journal and the second brain.</p>\n<p>A friend turned me on to the <a href=\"https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book\">&quot;bujo&quot;</a> after I asked about the notebook she carried everywhere. The thing that its creator, Ryder Carroll, says about it is that it's a &quot;mindfulness practice masquerading as a productivity method,&quot; and that's very true. Sitting down with a paper notebook and doing both your todos and your actual journaling is a great way to focus, be present, and stop farting around with the external for a minute. It's also great for people with focus issues or who have trouble sticking to systems, because you can just pick it back up if you flop for a while. Start journaling again where you left off. No biggie.</p>\n<p>However, I have years of notebooks stacked up and one thing they're not good at is indexing and re-accessing information and insights that you've achieved. This is where Tiago Forte's <em>Building a Second Brain</em> comes into play. The core thinking behind his system is almost the opposite of the bullet journal: It's only digital tools that can store and search in a way that enables us to truly offload a lot of data from our <em>first</em> brain.</p>\n<p>That makes a lot of sense, of course, and it's what tools like Evernote, Joplin, Roam, whatever were originally designed for — but it also brings me back home to a reason that GTD worked for me: David Allen's core slogan was &quot;If it's on your mind, it's not getting done.&quot; The second brain philosophy extends that to statements like &quot;it's not able to be accessed,&quot; &quot;it's not creative fodder,&quot; or more generally, &quot;if it's on your mind, it's not doing you any good.&quot;</p>\n<p>There's a lot more I love about the method but that's another post. But I still feel like I owe a lot to David Allen and his insane flowcharts designed to take things &quot;off your mind&quot; and turn you into a robot that always knows what to do. in this stupid-ass world where we have strayed pretty far from whatever-you-believe-in's light, it's a gift to be able to stop worrying about stuff for a few minutes.</p>\n",

But truly, we did lose some real ones in the music world.</p>\n<p>If you haven't heard of any of these folks, I suggest you check them out. There's a lot of great art here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Terry Hall.</strong> The last one of the year to go that I noticed, the <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-terry-hall/\">Specials singer</a> was a big loss to my musical history.</li>\n<li><strong>Keith Levine.</strong> I was a little late to PiL, but so many of the guitarists I admire, like Daniel Ash, owe a ton to him. His work on <em>Metal Box</em> still blows me away.</li>\n<li><strong>D.H. Peligro.</strong> An incredible drummer for one of the greats in hardcore, and one of the few and the proud who proved that punk wasn't just white guys and Bad Brains.</li>\n<li><strong>Jerry Lee Lewis.</strong> What can you say about the Killer that hasn't been said? Not the original wild man of rock and roll, but an early trash fire who paved the way for many more. Still energizing to listen to.</li>\n<li><strong>Pharaoh Sanders.</strong> One of the few jazz guys I really get into. Truly expanding stuff.</li>\n<li><strong>Andy Fletcher.</strong> Depeche Mode was an early expansion into electronic music for me, and probably half the known universe too.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark Lanegan.</strong> One of those guys who seemed to court death for a long time before they finally hooked up. A great lyricist and so unsung in the world of Seattle music.</li>\n<li><strong>Rachel Nagy.</strong> I think I only saw the Detroit Cobras once when I lived there, but they were legendary. Too young, and I still haven't heard what happened.</li>\n<li><strong>Vangelis.</strong> I was never a huge fan, but it's safe to say in hindsight he's one of the people who introduced me to electronic music. Maybe Jarre had more influence on me, but only because he came later — and because Vangelis's &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; was so omnipresent.</li>\n<li><strong>Lamont Dozier, Dennis Waterman, Ken WIlliams.</strong> You might not know these names. Look them up. That's a lot of firepower lost. These are guys with both art and craft, guys whose results are very difficult to argue with.</li>\n<li><strong>Klaus Schulze.</strong> Up until relatively recently, I knew him mostly from the first Tangerine Dream album and Ash Ra Tempel, but even that'd be enough to cement him in my mind as one of the greats. But then there's <em>Timewind,</em> <em>Angst,</em> and a billion other releases. A master.</li>\n<li><strong>The big hoedown in the sky.</strong> Country was hit hard in '22. C.W. McCall might've been a one-hit wonder (&quot;Convoy&quot;) but it was a monster and it always makes me think of my uncle who knew every word and maybe still does. Then Mickey Gilly, Naomi Judd, and Loretta Lynn? All pioneers and legends.</li>\n<li><strong>Classic rock radio.</strong> Dan McCafferty of Nazareth, Wilko Johnson of Dr. Feelgood, Christine McVee, Meat Loaf. Can't say I'm necessarily a fan of any of them, but their stature was undeniable. And of course, there's Meat's masterful performance in <em>Fight Club.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Coolio.</strong> It's fucking Coolio. How is Coolio gone?</li>\n<li><strong>Taylor Hawkins.</strong> The Foos are not one of my favorites either, but it sure seems to me that he was loved by pretty much everyone who came across him.</li>\n<li><strong>The lords of the synth.</strong> This year we lost both John Appleton, the inventor of the Synclavier, and <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/rip-dave-smith/\">Dave Smith</a>, the man behind Sequential Circuits and one half of the pair responsible for MIDI.</li>\n<li><strong>Ronnie Spector.</strong> Between her and Lamont Dozier both leaving the building, a massive chunk of Motown is gone. No disrespect to Diana Ross but Ronnie was always my favorite.</li>\n<li><strong>Angelo Badalamenti and Julee Cruise.</strong> This is some serious garmonbozia. <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/angelo/\">Angelo</a> had a good run at least, but I was hoping to hear more from him.</li>\n<li><strong>Mimi Parker.</strong> Saved the hardest for last. I truly don't know what to say about this one. So here's a video.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBtJpVY7NkE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n",

Arguably the only band <em>more</em> important for my branching-out was Joy Division.</p>\n<p>And I can't get enough of watching them play in their heyday.

      "content_html": "<p>Pretty regularly on the Novation Circuit subreddit, a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/novationcircuit/comments/zhzbmc/next_hardware_steps_from_tracks_rhythm/\">question like this</a> or a comment expressing the same general idea appears. I'm not familiar with any other music gear subs where the users are so often actively trying to get away from their chosen devices.</p>\n<p>The Circuit OG/Tracks/Rhythm are very interesting devices. Novation took the success of the Launchpad, an Ableton clip launch controller, and expanded it into a standalone device that really isn't like anything else. There's no screen. The pad grid serves as the user feedback for every function: step sequencing, keyboard, pattern launching, mixing, even the tempo display. That makes it a device that sometimes needs a great deal of memorizing (or RTFM, initially). But it also makes it a device that absolutely nails what it means to be <em>immediate</em> and <em>tactile</em> — attributes that screen-poisoned musicians supposedly crave these days when they step away from the DAW. There's no clicking, no menu diving, no using a scroll wheel to name a pattern. There's you, there's the buttons and knobs, and there's the music. And trust me, it's extremely quick to get to the &quot;music&quot; step. Features of both current-gen Circuits include one-button &quot;scene&quot; launching, sequencer probability and random mutation, pattern chaining for very long variations, and really usable reverb and delay.</p>\n<p>So why does everyone think they need to &quot;upgrade&quot; to an Elektron machine, an MPC, or god forbid a Roland MC-707?</p>\n<h2 id=\"cheap\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cheap... <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/#cheap\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Firstly, these things are not expensive. About $350 gets you a new one, and for better or worse this &quot;gotta upgrade&quot; attitude leaves Reverb stocked with them for much less. I think there's an attitude with all kinds of musicians that the more you spend, the better your stuff is. Surprise! That's bullshit. It's not that I'm that old blues lawyer guitarist insisting that &quot;tone is in the fingers&quot; — after all, these same people are connecting 1958 Les Pauls to Dumble amps via Monster cables.</p>\n<p>What I mean is electronic musical instruments are very rarely apples-to-apples comparisons. They all have their strengths and their frustrations. And good stuff has never been cheaper than it is right now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-unspecialized\" tabindex=\"-1\">And unspecialized... <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/#and-unspecialized\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The second thing is that, possibly because of said price, no pros have decided that these things have a certain space. If you want to make hard techno or dancey industrial, people like NIN and Richard Devine have sold you on Elektron machines and their hyped, exciter-pumped sounds. If you make lo-fi or boom bap, you want an SP-404 because Madlib, J Dilla, Flying Lotus, and who knows who else used one to make their iconic material. Even doofy gear gets this treatment at times, like the really uninspiring Microkorg being anointed the &quot;synth for an indie rock band that has a synth.&quot;</p>\n<p>What is the Circuit's space? It doesn't have one. I wouldn't say it's a &quot;master of none&quot; because it's quite good at plenty of things, but looking at it you don't say &quot;ah yes, this thing is for X.&quot;</p>\n<iframe id=\"reddit-embed\" src=\"https://www.redditmedia.com/r/novationcircuit/comments/vgvqt2/first_composition_with_both_tracks_and_rhythm/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true&amp;theme=dark\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups\" style=\"border: none;\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></iframe>\n<h2 id=\"just-like-me\" tabindex=\"-1\">Just like me. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-defense-of-the-novation-circuits/#just-like-me\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What I can say about the Circuits, especially the Circuit Tracks, is that they are now my centerpiece for both performing and composing, and in 20+ years of making live electronic music I have not owned another machine that enabled my way of working so thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Would I like more precise sample cutting onboard? Yeah probably. What about separate outputs? Always want those. But &quot;missing&quot; features like these imply that the very purposeful design of these devices somehow includes more mistakes than it actually does. And the sum of the features versus tradeoffs is unlike anything else out there for both utility and (<em>gasp</em>) fun. So I'm not sure that an upgrade would actually be one at all.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Partially because there have been vast swathes of my life that went un-gamed, and partially because I have only kept a nintendo console around for quite a few years now, I tend to get into games late. My latest to finally add to the pile was <em>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</em>, the main storyline of which I finished today, probably prematurely due to a week of being sick.</p>\n<h2 id=\"openness\" tabindex=\"-1\">Openness <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#openness\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Holy shit it's a lot of game. And unlike Skyrim, you can go just about anywhere. Nobody climbs like Link, but Geralt does a good job of getting around territory. At least until he dies of falling from any height greater than 6 feet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"combat\" tabindex=\"-1\">Combat <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#combat\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Like most 3d action RPGs, you can either parry or dodge-and-roll your way through combat. And as with all the rest, I take the latter path (arguably blocking is better since a perfect parry almost always gets you a nice opening — probably just one of the many reasons I'm shit at <em>Souls</em>). But either way the combat is a lot of fun. Much like Link's runes or a weapon/destruction hybrid build in Skyrim, the weapon and magic combo is really satisfying and gives combat a lot of variety. Geralt is a little slower to act than say, Link, but you get his timing down and you feel unstoppable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-mechanics-to-tell-the-story\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using mechanics to tell the story <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#using-mechanics-to-tell-the-story\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I really think one the bar to hit here is <em>Nier: Automata</em>, but W3 does a great job sporadically. Playing as Ciri in flashback (or her supremely overpowered moment near the end, one-hitting wild hunt warriors) is a fun mix-up that lets you &quot;live&quot; the story a bit more. With a few exceptions, I have very little idea what the dialog options did to my playthrough and that's kinda cool. I guess it's a choice-mechanic equivalent of the open world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bummers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bummers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/witchin/#bummers\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Like I said, something about the linear story that's very cleverly woven into an open-world game left me feeling &quot;done&quot; when it resolved. And I know there's a lot more there I haven't done.</p>\n<p>Load times are really unfortunate, at least on the Switch. In story-heavy sections, there's a lot of it. Fast travel feels not all that fast when you can sometimes ride your horse there faster.</p>\n<p>Frame rate is not great. <em>Automata</em> is a newer game that feels really intensive, but it rarely got herky-jerky. When it rains in a busy place like Novigrad (which is often), Geralt starts doing the robot. Weirder and more distracting is the crappy framerate in some cut scenes. In a game with so many of them, it's unfortunate.</p>\n<p>None of this impeding me enjoying the shit out of it. Even the fall damage thing, because I laughed my ass off every time Geralt died by tripping over a rock.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>The number of occasions I've heard masses of people say they're going to walk away from Twitter now numbers in the dozens over the years. The company has demonstrated contempt for the users that can be rivaled only by Meta, having pivoted many years ago from adding features based on usage (<em>Retweets</em>) to generally delivering weird non-features that even the advertisers don't really want (<em>Blue</em>).</p>\n<p>But now it's being bought by a guy who has latched onto the &quot;free speech brigade&quot; not because he's particularly pro-free-speech (he's not), or because his politics align with those kinds of people (they do), but because he seems dumb enough to believe their spiel (he might be). A union-buster, an apartheid-profiter, and a guy who has used the platform that will soon be his to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get yelled at by a Wachowski</li>\n<li>Libel the guy who saved that Thai sports team after nobody liked his coffin submarine idea</li>\n<li>Predict the end of COVID-19 with the accuracy of Nate Silver picking numbers out of a hat</li>\n<li>Generally sound like a dumbass who'd be cringey and goofy if he wasn't so simultaneously powerful</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway.

Somehow the email model of &quot;different servers but everyone can talk&quot; fails to make sense to me in a social media context.</p>\n<p>But I use Twitter less and less every year, and these days even the months show decline.

In that time, I have not really strayed from it, which is pretty unusual for me. I get really restless with tools. Thanks to a very active plugin community, theme ecosystem, and subreddit, it's become a great tool that is super customizable. I adapted a few times and that was no biggie at all thanks to the fact that Obsidian is based entirely around discrete files, stored in your file system, with their own regular ol' file names.</p>\n<p>My current way of operating is shamefully trendy; I'm using Tiago Forte's <em>Building a Second Brain</em> as the methodology. One reason is that it works reasonably well with other tools including paper journaling and <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/\">Raindrop</a> bookmarks. Though he apparently uses Evernote and swears by its search (which is still quite good despite Evernote's many problems), I think the linking features in Obsidian are really what makes it good for this system. Knowledge doesn't just go in a filing cabinet and get dusty. You can always see it thanks to links and unlinked mentions.</p>\n<p>I'm still not interested in changing, and as long as I am still locked into the old $5 rate for syncing, I will keep that as well.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Less than 3 weeks after making an appearance at Superbooth and looking healthy and enthusiastic, Dave Smith is dead at 72.</p>\n<p>If you don't know who he is, Smith is a synth pioneer who founded Sequential Circuits in the 70s. They made a lot of iconic synths but were most famous for the Prophet 5, pretty much the first programmable polyphonic synth. It really has yet to be topped, which is probably why the re-built company is still making a Prophet 5.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 80s he conceived of and developed a universal interface for synthesizers from different manufacturers to talk to each other. Whether the fact that it's still in use today is evidence of its effectiveness or of how out-of-date it is now, you can't argue that MIDI is one of the most important things to happen in the world of music since the development of the synthesizer itself. He and Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi (also sadly no longer with us) even received a Grammy for the development of MIDI.</p>\n<p>For those of us who might never afford a Prophet, MIDI is the great unifier. Since its inception, it has allowed the fanciest Oberheim, the lowliest Volca, your SP-404 loaded with samples of farts, whatever it is, to talk to each other. The standard even continues into the computer, where I can download MIDI files of Clyde Stubblefield playing drums and replace all the hits with sounds of dogs barking or car crashes. I'm sure that's exactly what Smith had in mind.</p>\n<p>And speaking of that, one of Smith's other ventures was the first real software synth, Reality. Though he didn't ultimately care for making music inside a computer, it's another project he spearheaded that pretty much changed music forever.</p>\n<p>So the only thing left to say is thanks. You'll be missed.</p>\n",

With the notable exceptions of UserZoom, Figma, and Overflow, I'm in MS world and that's been an adjustment after the world of Google Apps and other lightweight, web-based tools.</p>\n<p>There's a benefit to being entirely in Microsoftland, or at least in theory there is. Kinda looks like with the advent of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop?ms.url=microsoftcommicrosoft-loop\">Loop</a> they are trying to make good on that theory and put it into real practice.</p>\n<p>So to say that Loop is a Notion ripoff seems partially true. But for those of us stuck here in Office 365 with no hope of using the real thing, that's totally <em>fine</em>. Just like Planner is not Trello and Todo isn't quite what Wunderlist was, and Power Automate is far from being as easy to work as IFTTT or Zapier — but they exist. I can imagine a lightweight database table like what Notion employs would be so much easier for many of the small tasks where I'm using SharePoint Lists. But the &quot;components&quot; feature of Loop seems to be where MS are really trying to take it a bit further.</p>\n<p>The idea behind components seems to be that the pieces of functionality (like Notion blocks?) are available elsewhere in the Office ecosystem: Teams chats, Word docs, email messages. And that's the kind of interoperability that we really don't enjoy today, even though that should be a prime selling point of Microsoftland. Mail Merge isn't exactly the future.

So there's an appetite for those simpler days. All the myriad ways we've strayed from Hypertext's light would take quite a few more blog posts and sound like an old man yelling at clouds, but in terms of web design it feels pretty specific. Build tools. Compiled code. Scoping and renaming classes at runtime. Arguments about whether to put CSS in JS. Not gonna belabor that, you get it.</p>\n<p>I taught myself to ditch tables around 2002-2003 by reading Eric Meyer's O'Reilly title <em>CSS: The Definitive Guide</em>, which is purely a reference title. It was not what I would call complicated. It probably took me just as long to figure out how to implement Grunt, which was already supplanted by Gulp by that time. Life is complicated, and I guess life in CSS has gotten that way as well. It feels such a long way from the <a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">CSS Zen Garden</a>.</p>\n<p>I don't necessarily think that breakpoints and media queries are an extreme example of the complication — remember conditional comments? Remember writing separate sites from Netscape and Internet Explorer? But I do think Utopia's authors asserting that their framework is &quot;declarative&quot; instead of &quot;prescriptive&quot; or &quot;instructive&quot; brings it back to the fundamentals of CSS. I find it a bit ironic though that they're using some really complicated calculations to achieve simplicity for the user. I recognize that bootstrap does something similar when calculating the grid, but the deeper the math I don't understand burrows, the more scared I am of relying on it.</p>\n<p>I haven't read enough of the material here to understand how they handle anything other than the spacing and typography — and whether they like it or not, there is more to it than that, even if those are the only two things you <em>can't</em> take away. Looks like it may be relying on CSS grids to keep things in one media space. And lord knows I haven't adequately learned CSS grids yet. But I'm going to give this a shot. Maybe the next version of this site will be Utopian.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Few pieces of gear are, on their own, really inspiring. Even the worst gear has its merits, but even the best sounding stuff isn't enough to be a wellspring of creativity. Ableton Live comes to mind, as well as the truly unique Novation Circuit, a cheap groovebox with no screen that I love almost as much as a family pet.</p>\n<p>Lately I've been digging an old school piece of hardware that probably sounds the least likely to fall into this category. The <strong>Alesis MMT-8</strong> is technically not a sequencer, but an 8-channel MIDI &quot;recorder&quot; and playback machine. It really does work a lot like an 8-track tape machine, but with MIDI data instead of audio. That means that it can control up to 8 devices by either playing notes, triggering their own sequencers, sending program change, and transmitting CC data. It's become the central master of my setup, and though it has its faults, it's so refreshing to get away from the computer for real that I'm itching to get on with writing new music.</p>\n<p>It's a strange design that could only come out of the late 80s, like Knight Rider. It shares the lazer-zap shape with its brother the HR-16 (precursor to the <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/in-praise-of-the-alesis-sr-16\">most successful drum machine of all time</a>, as well as the strange flip-up panel on top that contains an abbreviated user manual. Oddly, that shape does have the advantage of fitting a Korg Volca really nicely.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/mmt8.jpg\" alt=\"Alesis MMT-8\" /></p>\n<p>The first &quot;issue&quot; with the machine is that it doesn't have a very accurate clock. It's slow by about a whole BPM. If you want to be tempo-accurate, you need something else to send the data. On its own though, it has a pretty solid clock, though it purely transmits what was recorded into it, so if you want some unique feel or timing with &quot;character&quot; you'll need to trigger other sequencers. I'm just dreading when I play a show and someone comes up to me to say &quot;I bet you thought you were playing at 74 bpm but that was really 73.&quot; They're out there. I'm sure of it.</p>\n<p>The one workflow issue it has is a lack of overdubbing. If, for instance, I want drums and hi hats to be on the same track, I have to play the whole mess at once. Potentially a challenge, and more or less impossible if I want some kind of CC data at the same time. So those have to go on different channels. That being said, I have yet to feel like I need more than 8 channels. And when I do, I'll probably just find another MMT for about a hundred bucks. It does have extremely detailed editing capability as long as you're willing to do it on a 2-line LCD screen with squishy rubber buttons.</p>\n<p>It's remarkably fast and intuitive once you're in there, and that has always been the most important thing to me in a creative tool. Get me punching in notes and feeling the song, not thinking about how a thing works. And it's rare to get that along with the immediacy of hardware.</p>\n<p>So, Alesis MMT-8, I salute you.</p>\n",

Sure, the Rick Wakemans (and Linus Torvalds) of the world might want more, but they have their complicated alternatives. For the rest of us, it was finally time to make music with synths. Just watch any gear-focused interview with John Foxx, Gary Numan, George Clinton, Rick Wright, you name it — the Model D hugely influenced their worlds so they could influence the rest of the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/modeld.jpg\" alt=\"Minimoog Model D\" /></p>\n<p>This philosophy can still be controversial at times, as with GNOME 3 (which, incidentally, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2691192/how-gnome-3-14-is-winning-back-disillusioned-linux-users.html\">has become less loathed</a> in the years since its release), but in general the idea of solving for the 90% of users who don't need 50% of the features is considered an obvious one nowadays.</p>\n<p>Of course, modulars have seen a resurgence lately because once you're in deep you inevitably want to start making your own synths. But that hasn't stopped the steady stream of simplistic analog boxes like the Volca series or Behringer's slavish old-school synth imitations. Options are great, but menu diving is no fun and the quickest way to get a musician to love your instrument is to get them creating quickly.</p>\n<p>And this, as the article gets across pretty well, is what we should learn from Moog.</p>\n<p>Apple would've patented the pitch wheel though.</p>\n",

I've read posts like this from people more tech-savvy and smarter than myself, and I don't think I can go that hard. It sounds... tough. I just want to stop depending on them, stop letting them see everything I do, and generally stop supporting them. There are so many reasons out there for doing so, but that's not what this is about.

And some are just gonna have to slide, no doubt about it, but I'll get there eventually. Here's where I'm at with alternatives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gmail.</strong> I looked at Proton, which is great if you really want to get into the extremes of privacy, and a few others, before settling on <a href=\"http://fastmail.com/\">Fastmail</a>. Fastmail won out for its UI, pricing to storage ratio, and inclusion of a calendar. Some friends' recommendations sealed that deal. Fastmail also features alias boxes, which can send or receive mail, and those are helping me get rid of the numerous random Gmail boxes in addition to the main one.</li>\n<li><strong>Docs.</strong> At the end of the day, I so rarely need a word processor and almost any will work. My personal hangup about docs is that I usually want structure rather than WYSIWYG layouts. It's a big part of why I use <s>Notion</s> Obsidian and frankly in most cases I'll just publish a PDF out of there. I write my post drafts in there since it's Markdown. But Apple's Pages online and MS Word online are totally fine, and more recently I found the hosted version of open-source OnlyOffice. As a bonus, it's a great replacement for the aging and frustrating LibreOffice on the Linux desktop.</li>\n<li><strong>Sheets.</strong> When Google Sheets launched, it was insane. Zoho had done it, but not well, and that's about it. There are all kinds of great tools out there now that make a spreadsheet seem quaint, but sometimes you just need a spreadsheet. It's still the &quot;killer app.&quot; And the originator is still pretty good at it. <a href=\"http://excel.office.com/\">Excel</a> online is a little more computer-intensive, but it does the thing well and doesn't get into other stuff. Coda is a possibility, but the learning curve is steep, and I've seen recommendations for Airtable but as cool as it is (I use it for a few things) it's really a different animal. OnlyOffice wins again, for anything that needs more math and fewer relationships than I would handle with Airtable.</li>\n<li><strong>Drive.</strong> My god, it's full of storage. There are so many alternatives out there it's not even worth it. If you want to use the same provider as your docs or sheets, then go with Microsoft or Apple. If privacy is your main value, try <a href=\"http://pcloud.com/\">pCloud</a> or Mega. I've personally gone with pCloud because of its media capabilities and generous size (not to mention its charmingly rough edges and desktop Linux integration), but my eggs are well distributed among many baskets.</li>\n<li><strong>Photos.</strong> Unlike email, there just aren't a lot of low-cost storage options for photos. Flickr has been so fucked-with for so long since Yahoo! took over that I can't make heads or tails of where they're going with it, and most services (that aren't AMZ) are geared toward photographers, not regular folks backing up their stuff. So for now, I have nothing except redundant external drives and possibly a larger pCloud plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Chromebook.</strong> Obviously Google tracking your entire operating system is not super ideal. However, this was easier to resolve than I expected. <a href=\"https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton\">Crouton</a> makes it easy to install a Linux environment with xfce. I'm still tweaking but it's working pretty well, especially considering my Chromebook runs on a Rockchip, which I think is like an ARM?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The world of technology used to be this way. We used the best provider for each service or application. The idea of going to a one-stop shop is relatively new. Yeah, it makes things simple, but if the price for turning computing devices into dead-simple consumer electronics is all my privacy, I'm going to try to roll my own life.</p>\n",

But I've been assured by some owners of the original that it was also a plastic box that you wouldn't want to drop from too far up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/td3.jpg\" alt=\"TD-3\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"sounds\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sounds <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/#sounds\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>So how does it sound? There are plenty of YouTube videos at this point, but more than any other piece of synth gear I have, it does One Thing. It does that thing right, though. There are two wave shapes, the saw and square, and simplistic filter controls that were meant for guitarists rather than subtractive synth experts to work. The TB-3 adds a nice distortion option that the 303 lacked, and it really helps the bass cut through a thicker mix. I almost never turn it off, especially on the square wave shape. There's also a little patch bay at the top that lets you do some very basic CV controls. I could probably sync the filter to the kick pattern of the Volca Beats or send gate info to the Microbrute arpeggiator, but I have yet to play with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sequences\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sequences <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/#sequences\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The one thing that I almost wish wasn't so authentic is the sequencer. It works by programming notes, then by going back and programming all their lengths, including rests and holds. You really have to plan out your patterns in advance before starting to punch buttons. Fortunately, you can switch the thing into pitch mode and send it notes from somewhere else, like Ableton Live or my Alesis MMT-8 sequencer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"summary\" tabindex=\"-1\">Summary <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/new-device-behringer-td-3/#summary\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Those folks who automatically won't buy Behringer aside (I get you), the TB-3 isn't a device for everyone. It only does one thing, and chances are it'll makes you think of acid house as soon as it starts playing. But if you need bass in your setup, you could do a lot worse than around a hundred bucks for something that can shake the floor.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I suppose I was fortunate, really. My band's drummer, who also wrote maybe 70% of the guitar riffs, finished his PhD and left the country to go work in Switzerland. Writing out that sentence makes me realize he was the <em>really</em> fortunate one. But what I mean is, a lot of my musician friends had to deal with the fact that they couldn't get together during the pandemic. For better or worse, I didn't have a band anymore to worry about.  Fortunately, prior to 2020 I'd released about a dozen releases (between digital, CD and cassette) over the past 20 years that featured no other musicians but me. So I started to hit the shed.</p>\n<p>I've been a process musician for most of that time. Each project, each release, is the result of a way of working. It comes from being in the experimental world for so long. Now, even when I make something that I find enjoyable to listen to, it's still gonna be made via a specific process. And when I make something with that process, I tend to move on. But that kind of indulgence is tough for someone with kids and a day job. Movement doesn't happen quickly enough, and output is minimal.</p>\n<p>So I came up with the plan of forcing myself into the shed once a week, and I decided I wasn't going to come out of the shed until I had a finished song.  Talking it out with a friend, I realized this accomplishes a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It opens the throttle on that speed of progress. If you just &quot;play around&quot; once a week for a couple hours, you're not going to get anywhere for a long time. Validating an idea once a week gets you through the ruts and the familiar patterns and into new ideas sooner.</li>\n<li>It keeps you from being precious about polish and &quot;finish.&quot; The dumb truth of a piece of music or art is that it's finished when you say it is. <em>Bee Thousand</em> is just as &quot;finished&quot; as <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, and they're both classics of their space. One was made by a group of guys with infinite time and money, and the other was made by a drunk schoolteacher with kids.</li>\n<li>It makes you go with your gut. Maybe if I hadn't been doing this for close to 25 years, I wouldn't feel like the gut was a useful thing. But the gut has become experienced.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm currently using this process to create new Various Reasons tunes, always with the further constraint that someday they can be recreated live, but the first work I did with a &quot;live band&quot; style and put onto Bandcamp as Mezzo Cortex.</p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4022765204/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=f171a2/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://mezzocortex.bandcamp.com/album/a-litany-of-bad-news\">A Litany of Bad News by mezzo cortex</a></iframe>\n",

Like any experimental musician who likes to turn guitars into other sounds, I spend a lot of time trying to balance versatility and ease of use. Nobody likes to tap dance one-footed, even if you can perform an entire symphony.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the last year, I've really landed on a layout that I like. In order of the signal chain, here it is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"boss-tu-2\" tabindex=\"-1\">Boss TU-2 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#boss-tu-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Not much to say about this. Fancy tuners come around every once in a while, but for accuracy, visibility, and durability, it's hard to beat the classic Boss.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pepers-pedals-rad\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pepers Pedals RAD <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#pepers-pedals-rad\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is a Rat pedal. Pretty simple. It's made by Tony Pepers in New Zealand, and when you buy his pedals they come with this amazing gummy candy that's only available there. There are standard Rat controls and a switch that changes the clipping mode from standard Rat to Turbo Rat, or removes the clipping altogether. Without clipping, it's decidedly less Rat-like but it's still a very hairy fuzz. I don't stack overdrives and distortions anymore. I just crank up a Rat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"morley-mini-volume\" tabindex=\"-1\">Morley Mini Volume <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#morley-mini-volume\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I love the size of this thing. I always put volume pedals after the distortion, even though I sometimes can't get total silence with it rocked down, because that way the tone doesn't change when I fade it up and down. I do waffle on whether to put it in front of or behind my preamp pedal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"joyo-british-sound\" tabindex=\"-1\">Joyo British Sound <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#joyo-british-sound\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Yes, this is 100% a ripoff, possibly a stolen board design, of the Tech 21 British pedal, and it's probably unethical to buy this or any Joyo pedal because even the original designs have been more or less funded by this kind of stuff. But damn, it cost me $20 and it helps add that throaty, low-midrange roar to my plain sounding solid state amp. Plus I can dial in just the right amount of gain so that even the clean tone has a tiny bit of breakup. That helps make my cleans a little softer on the attack and less obviously solid-state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"line-6-m5\" tabindex=\"-1\">Line 6 M5 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#line-6-m5\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Line 6 is not exactly the most prestigious brand to put on your board, but this pedal is ridiculously useful for keeping said board from getting completely out of hand. I use it primarily for modulation and special effects. I currently use the M5 for the pitch detune effect at the end of &quot;We Are The Life of the Future,&quot; and for wah/filter during &quot;We Live Inside.&quot; Both of these use the M-Audio expression pedal that's plugged into it (another not-great brand but it's lasted longer than the Roland one I used to have). Beyond the tremolos, choruses, flangers and other modulators, there are some fun (if not super useful) synth sounds and other random effects. Any effect can have its settings changed with the expression, which makes it doubly useful. And it's true-bypass, so even if you're worried about Patented Line 6 Tone altering your signal, it's alright. Personally, I would never use the preamp and distortion sounds, they're just not that good, but for single-use sounds you don't want to add a whole pedal for... why not?</p>\n<h3 id=\"seymour-duncan-deja-vu\" tabindex=\"-1\">Seymour Duncan Deja Vu <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#seymour-duncan-deja-vu\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is a little-known delay with a hugely useful feature set and a great, live-friendly layout. There's tap tempo that can be set to either delay at the exact tempo you press, or at measure divisions, e.g. you tap the quarter note but it'll delay on a dotted eighth. It has an analog circuit simulator (cuts a lot of highs out of the repeats) with variable modulation (warble, basically) and you can dial any combination between the digital and analog for a lot of tonal variation. You can switch between tails or true bypass (I usually leave tails on and it doesn't really suck tone at all). As a bonus, cranking the delay speed knob way over will give you a looper function.</p>\n<p>As if all that wasn't enough, you can plug a TRS into its &quot;insert&quot; jack and put a whole chain of effects there that will only effect the repeats. That's what the Boss PS-2 is doing there: adding either compounding delays or pitch shifts to the repeats. Insane possibilities.</p>\n<p>It's basically the best delay pedal I've ever used, and the right combination of simple and powerful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"catalinbread-topanga\" tabindex=\"-1\">Catalinbread Topanga <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#catalinbread-topanga\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I switch reverbs out sometimes but this one is too fun to leave at home. It's supposed to be an emulation of a Fender spring reverb unit. Yes, you can get some super wet Dick Dale sounds out of it. One of its more enjoyable features is that it's sensitive to volume and creates breakup as you feed it a louder signal. Made in Portland.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hotone-wally\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hotone Wally <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#hotone-wally\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I may never figure out how to pronounce Hotone, but the Wally is a great little looper. You can stack a lot of loops of different times, you can change their pitch after you've recorded, and change the output volume of the playback. Great features for a tiny pedal. Unfortunately with its single button it's complicated to control and you can't end a loop at an exact time. And believe it or not, for most boards it's actually a little too small. I can't manage to get enough Velcro on the thing to keep it from moving around, and there's nowhere to zip-tie it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tc-voicelive-not-pictured\" tabindex=\"-1\">TC Voicelive (not pictured) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#tc-voicelive-not-pictured\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The empty space usually has my vocal processor on it. This thing is basically just delays, but it has some sort of compression and possibly EQ in it because everything comes out of it sounding so polished. It was purchased by my bandmate from Mike Scheidt, so it's seen some action but it's really tough. Unlike many other vocal effects I've used, sound people do not hate it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-board\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Board <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/boring-gear-post-pedalboard-layout/#the-board\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The board itself is a handmade wooden job that a friend built at a custom size for a pretty meager amount of money. I painted and velcro'd it, and even though it doesn't have a case and the slats can be a bit weird for the odd form-factor pedals like the Deja Vu, it's solid and really does the trick. The power supply is hidden out of sight and I have been able to velcro-tie the extra cabling. I just need to get an angled plug into that Topanga...</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Most UX researchers will parrot the line that focus groups are terrible, and even if they are parroting, they're right. Erika Hall, in <em>Just Enough Research</em>, calls focus groups &quot;research theater.&quot;</p>\n<p>But often, you'll find that budget and/or time constraints can manipulate your beautifully planned user research into a focus group. Is there anything you can do about it?</p>\n<p>As usual, Pentagram and other gatekeeping haters be damned, design thinking (or human-centered design) comes to the rescue. Co-design doesn't just mean working in cross-functional teams in your own organization, it means involving your users. If we truly believe that they know best, then why not involve them?</p>\n<p>About a year ago, I got access to a group of young people who were acting as an advisory board to a client. The client made e-learning modules for an urban teen market and we were building the interface and helping with their product design philosophy. The problem with this access was that not only were the kids biased — they had volunteered for the position and were paid a stipend — but when they got together they were effectively a focus group. All of them were smart and motivated, but they weren't always motivated to give the kind of feedback we needed, and we continued to see patterns of one person leading the group (a standard focus group behavior).</p>\n<p>Since we met them regularly, I started to give them homework. They put together mood boards and talked about the kinds of sites they regularly visited. Maybe they all colluded, but it didn't matter quite as much because it was an intentional collaboration on their part in this case.</p>\n<p>Then we eased into some design thinking exercises, and conducted a design studio workshop. I instructed them to think of the particular details of what made them frustrated with, apathetic to, or unable to operate the current layouts. Then they drew. Standard practice applies here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We were remote, but I instructed the moderators to give them sharpies so we didn't fall into the detailed drawing trap.</li>\n<li>The youth liaison to the company, as well as the product leader and another product manager, participated.</li>\n<li>The drawings were timeboxed, then presented and lightly critiqued as a group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They took pictures and sent them to us, and we did affinity mapping and more detailed analysis after the workshop.</p>\n<p>None of this is really rocket surgery, but it's worth mentioning that as long as you have the right participants, any user research should be considered useful and there's a lot of value in being able to &quot;make lemonade.&quot;</p>\n",

The thing that the author is mad about does not seem to be the kind of design thinking that I have either implemented or learned.</p>\n<p>The whole point of &quot;human centered design&quot; is to eliminate the concept of the designer dictating from on high. The version the author refers to, where a holy anointed designer filters the input of the unwashed masses, is something I'm wholly against as well. After all, I went to a two-year for-profit design school. Iskander has the right idea: we should be democratizing design and acting on the bottom-up, boots-on-the-ground perspective that we get from users/customers/beneficiaries and from non-designers in our organization. Unfortunately, it feels to me like she's been given a tainted version of design thinking -- one that I think a lot of other people have also received.</p>\n<p>My cognitive dissonance here is that these articles written by people named Natasha can't both be true. Jen, highfalutin Pentagram partner, can't be right about design thinking usurping the dominance of designers like her while Iskander is simultaneously right about the methods actually maintaining that dominance.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, design thinking is, as Iskander says, a dumbed-down scientific method. So to my mind, what you do with that hypothesize-and-test framework can be conservative (blarg), innovative (bleh), or serve people well, depending on your hypotheses, the makeup of your team, and the projects you're working on. Keep the tools in your toolbox, keep serving the people you're designing for, and you'll be fine.</p>\n",

To some people, Ableton Live and its external controllers made the question moot. And to a large number of others, Elektron’s highly playable devices have become the de facto way of low-impact performance design.</p>\n<p>But when you’re not interested in bringing out a computer and you don’t have nice Elektron stuff, creating a way to connect and perform on your equipment is a fun and sometimes ridiculous challenge.</p>\n<p>Various Reasons, for me, has always been about this. And usually it’s been a little too complicated and unreliable to make things easy to play. But discovering some of the features of my Alesis Micron has really opened up my options.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-it-is\" tabindex=\"-1\">What it is <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/synthesizin/#what-it-is\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Today, my setup starts with the (non-pro) Arturia BeatStep, which mostly provides master clock but runs the sequence on a couple songs. It’s a fun way to run things because even though I can’t hard-wire a tempo to songs, the analog clock helps me go by “feel” a little bit.</p>\n<p>From there, the MIDI chain goes to the Micron, which can run a multi-track sequencer. Unfortunately, having multiple sequences in songs means holding down keys and moving your finger around. That’s fine in some cases, and in others I’ve adapted tunes to use the same bassline moved around in key. There can even be rhythms.</p>\n<p>In theory, a whole song can be built on the Micron, but I consider my modded Alesis HR-16 to be a signature part of my sound. So that is next in the chain. The snare runs to a cheap delay pedal to help alter sounds and add dubby effects to the beats. From there, I send MIDI clock to my Arturia Microbrute, which is almost always running an arpeggiator timed to that clock. It goes through a preamp for distortion and a Catalinbread spring reverb.</p>\n<p>The last piece is a Korg Volca Keys. I use it for pads, leads, and with\nthe aid of a Hotone Wally looper, transitions between songs for less awkward silence while I change patches. The hardest part of this is hitting keys, but I don’t have a small enough MIDI controller to justify bringing out something else.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/vrsrsns.jpg\" alt=\"Setup\" /></p>\n<p>It’s not the simplest setup I have. There are quite a few connections, and a couple analog synths with no patch recall. It does make changing parts within songs much easier than my previous setup, which had me running around like a crazy person trying to change patterns on multiple sequencers — some of which require two fingers. It’s got a bit of a shambolic timing, which is not ideal in some cases, but a lot more interesting and unique than a perfect computer or Octatrack clock. An audience member described it as “raw,” but to excerpt some of the lyrics, it’s also a mess of tangled wires.</p>\n",

When you need things like crossfades, effects on regions, and DDP export... you need them. It's another 300 bucks to upgrade Studio One to the version that has a mastering workflow, so guess who isn't doing that? I'm continually frustrated by DSP-Quattro's odd workflows and constant crashing, but it does the job eventually.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, though, I gave REAPER a shot at it. If you're not familiar, Reaper (it's an acronym but I get really tired of capitalizing it) is a constantly-developing DAW that carries a $60 price tag for amateurs and $225 for pros. My impression of Reaper has always been that it's a technician's tool or &quot;computer person&quot; version of a DAW. That is to say, kind of the opposite of Pro Tools's heavy mimicry of a console-based workflow. One thing that its proponents are always fond of pimping is the customization. Reaper can, within reason, work any way you want it to, but there's a massive learning and setup curve to get there.</p>\n<p>Or maybe not. Turns out, it isn't that hard to do a lot of the customizations that force Reaper to work the way you want to work, from tool behavior to making F3 toggle the mixer like Pro Tools.</p>\n<p>It also sounds at least as good as Studio One, and has a much cleaner, more native-feeling interface than it used to. And I think that the the &quot;computer-like&quot; focus of the UI as opposed to slavish console worship is actually a strength. There are no audio or MIDI tracks, just <em>tracks</em>, and there are no groups, VCAs, or busses. Every track can be anything, so it supports an &quot;as you go&quot; creative workflow. Takes and playlists work easily.</p>\n<p>The shortcoming that most DAWs run up against versus Pro Tools is always audio editing, so that remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>I'm going to continue any client work that comes along in Studio One, but try the next <a href=\"http://anemptyroom.net/\">An Empty Room</a> recording with Reaper and see how it goes.</p>\n",

I think a better way to put it is that we've been discovered out here in our clubhouse and now we're gonna have to grow up and play ball with everyone else. But this widely-shared article from Marvel (a tool I like a lot) has missed the mark in a couple fundamental ways.</p>\n<p>First, strategy is not for everyone. We did what I think is a great job designing strategy at D&amp;B, and it was in itself a design challenge. But not everyone on the team was involved or wanted to be involved. Disparaging non-strategic UX as a &quot;production&quot; role is an insulting mistake. This is skilled practitioner stuff, and there are <em>still</em> very few people who are actually good at it. The fact that there are exponentially more UX designers out there doesn't mean there are infinitely more good ones, especially since new folks are being raised on hot takes. So trying to convince the relatively few good ones to move on to strategic roles in companies that still need their user advocacy is not gonna help those companies.</p>\n<p>Especially if your next aim is to get those designers on the growth or marketing trains.</p>\n<p>&quot;Growth hacking&quot; is what UX designers are destined for now? Or social media marketing? Turn me into glue now, then, thanks. UX efforts are necessary in all of these worlds, and product marketing is inextricably tied to product design — but the core tenets of UX are unaffected by Valley trends (like &quot;growth hacking&quot;) or marketing efforts, which are famous for attempting to <em>subvert</em> the true needs of the user.</p>\n<p>Let's not lose the voice of the user in an attempt to stay relevant to a fad-driven Product Hunting world. And if the going wisdom is &quot;we solved that, time to move the talented designers on to growth hacking and marketing,&quot; then I'd consider that all the more reason why UX is still badly needed on the ground.</p>\n",

It's a big reason Comic Sans persists, and presumably why sites like Creative Market are flooded with handwritten custom typefaces. I find it hard to hate on small business owners who wanted their signs or truck stickers to be less brutalist.

      "title": "Switching to Studio One",
      "content_html": "<p>I recently worked to record my band's new EP, and decided to do something I don't normally have the opportunity to do when someone's paying me: I changed my DAW.</p>\n<p>Backstory: my Mac is starting to become inoperable due to the longstanding need for operating system updates. Recently Chrome decided it didn't like my version of Mac OS anymore. But if I start moving to the California editions, I have to switch to Pro Tools 12. And if you don't know what that means, imagine moving from Adobe CS to Creative Cloud. Yeah, I sunk a lot of money into Pro Tools and I'm not really into paying $25 a month or $300 for a year at this point.</p>\n<p>So, I pulled out some old You Might Think We're Sharks base tracks from our last session that never got overdubs, and finished <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/soundofsharks/summer-moon\">&quot;Summer Moon&quot;</a> in Presonus Studio One, which I've been threatening to switch to for a while.</p>\n<p>It went well, so I recorded An Empty Room's new one on it as well. There are some tradeoffs, but overall it's just a better experience and I wish I'd done it sooner. One thing I missed from Cubase is that the music creation and mixing portions were well integrated. In recent years since dropping Cubase, I tend to compose in Ableton, then finalize and mix in Pro Tools. In Studio One, though it's obviously not the same as Ableton, I'm able to integrate composition, tracking, and mixing pretty well. That works for our workflow since we'll add synths and samples in the mix process after doing the tracking.</p>\n<p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native compatibility with my hardware, which is made by Presonus as well.</li>\n<li>Almost everything is faster. To send tracks to a bus, just select them all, right click, and select &quot;Create Bus from selected tracks.&quot; No more routing.</li>\n<li>Track presets and plugin groups (so you can save an entire chain of plugins that you use often).</li>\n<li>Stock EQ has a frequency analyzer.</li>\n<li>VSTs and AUs are invariably cheaper and more available than AAX.</li>\n<li>Comping is incredible. Just highlight each part of the take (&quot;Layer&quot; in Studio One) you want to promote and it's done.</li>\n<li>Fades are automatic (like Ableton), and they can be tweaked with bezier curves, as can automation.</li>\n<li>Dragging and dropping, in most cases, replaces menus and routing. Even importing audio files: just drag them in, and when you save the file Studio One asks if you want to copy the audio files to the project directory.</li>\n<li>As of version 3.4, there is a Smart Tool just like Pro Tools.</li>\n<li>Macros.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I miss the single-stroke keyboard shortcuts. Leaving the modifier keys behind always made me feel like my keyboard was transformed into a spaceship control center. There are a few in S1, but not as many.</li>\n<li>By that same token, keyboard focus is sometimes wobbly. You can search for plugins in the Insert/Send menus, which is amazing. But you can't reliably use the keyboard to select the one you find, and I end up selecting tracks, soloing them, etc.</li>\n<li>Audio stretching is unintuitive.</li>\n<li>No Beat Detective equivalent that I know of. I didn't use it that much anyway.</li>\n<li>Nothing like Xpand! in the Artist version, but I recently picked up the VST version for a buck.</li>\n<li>That's... about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm currently using Artist Edition with the iPad remote and VST plugin support upgrades. Most of the features that I would love to have in Pro Edition are not things that Pro Tools even had, like the Arranger Track.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a small curve, a relatively painless experience, and I didn't lose much for features. Certainly didn't lose any fun.</p>\n",

So loading up the rack spaces in my mix desk with outboard gear doesn't make a lot of sense. Maybe it would if I had some rackmount synths, but I don't. I previously traveled to remote gigs in a giant <a href=\"http://www.guitarcenter.com/Odyssey/Carpeted-Combo-Mixer-Rack-Case-6-Space-1274115053698.gc\">Odyssey mixer case</a> with 9 spaces on top and 6 on the bottom. It's ridiculous, even after adding casters, and near-impossible to load into the truck without risk of a hernia.</p>\n<p>But even the smallest portable rack case is crazy expensive for my purposes. I'm not going on tour.

Assembled as-is with some rack rails attached, it'll hold 6U worth of rack gear. But a slight modification lets it hold 8U. I added handles and a flourescent light in the back, spray painted it black, <em>et voila</em>, a stupid-simple case.</p>\n<p>With the bigger items like my ART preamp, there isn't a lot of horizontal room left, but if I ever did this again I think I'd move the rack rails a little farther inside so the knobs were more protected. And for <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/44361109/\">$15 at IKEA</a>, I suppose I <em>could</em> make another attempt.</p>\n<p>Cost breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IKEA Rast - $14.99</li>\n<li>Rack rails - $6.96 x 2</li>\n<li>Spray paint - $3</li>\n<li>Handles - $3 x 2</li>\n<li>Total: Under $45</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closest thing I could find pre-made: <a href=\"http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/RK8\">$130</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/rack_case_sm.jpg\" alt=\"DIY rack\" /></p>\n<p>FYI, my el cheapo signal chain, from the bottom up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BBE bass EQ and preamp.</strong> I dislike the Sonic Maximizer and the &quot;BBE Sound&quot; in general, but this thing will even out a crappy bass guitar and give it some sustain and punch.</li>\n<li><strong>ART Pro MPA II (Gold Edition) mic preamp.</strong> ART get no love, but their black 2U tube units (MPA, VLA, Channel) sell for under $200 and they sound good. The Gold Edition swaps tubes for a less hissy gain. I mostly use it on vocals, but if you have to record a guitar direct it'll give you real tube gain, which will make any plugin amp simulator sound that much more authentic.</li>\n<li><strong>dbx 266xs compressor.</strong> I believe the &quot;xs&quot; stands for &quot;extra shitty&quot; when it comes to dbx's model line, but honestly it's still a dbx compressor. Which means it's pretty transparent and easy to use as well. For vocals I'll dial in some light compression when recording, but it's useful as a limiter as well if that's all you need.</li>\n<li><strong>Symetrix 525 compressor.</strong> I guess these things were originally for radio (duck the music as the DJ talks) but the sound is pretty darn good; I tend to use it to fatten/lengthen the sound of snares. Symetrix compressors have the distinction of being ultra-cheap (now and forever) but somehow approved by the GearSlutz community as useful tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Presonus Firestudio Project.</strong> I now have two of these interfaces because they're that good. For the money, it's almost impossible to beat the Presonus stuff. Decent gain on the preamps (could be better for vocals but that's what the ART is for), low noise, and pretty configurable and versatile. Chaining two is a breeze and gives you 16 mic inputs and 10 stereo outputs for a good bit less than a grand. I have never actually done remote recording with all 16, but in theory you could do a pretty good sized band at once.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Throughout, she answers questions that real people doing real things with real style guides are going to ask: how rigid should I be, what tools should I use, what about maintenance once it's built... etc.</p>\n<p>Overall, it's a short read but dense with useful, practical information from that rare breed — a developer who can write and explain concisely and clearly. If you've gotten on board the philosophical train of style guides but aren't sure where to start, it's a good buy at $8. <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">Get it here.</a></p>\n",

I love — and need— the idea of a self-contained piece of UI that I can drop anywhere. At its best, this is front-end methodology as UX improvement, because the consistency of those pieces of UI helps the overall experience. Even without that benefit, it aids in speed of dev.

That's especially true when your primary selling point as a recordist is mobility. I would probably love to get nothing but mix jobs — the work is fun, solitary, and low-pressure as long as you meet deadlines — but the challenges that take me out of my comfort zone are a big part of what make recording interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>The Nouns</strong> are a hip-hop and jazz crossover with elements of rock and R&amp;B. They have a level of accessibility that jazz groups don't often achieve, and their talent level is sky-high. Their lineup consists of drums, keys, bass, sax, jazz singer (with some R&amp;B/soul flavor) and an MC.</p>\n<p>My strategy would be to mic them up for multi-tracking but not to get too angsty about bleed. They performed in a barely acoustic-treated music classroom at the University for a video shoot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\" tabindex=\"-1\">Challenges <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#challenges\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The first unique aspect of this session would be running live sound in a small room while simultaneously recording. The drums didn't need amplification, and the bass and keyboard player both had amps. So I piped everything through my computer in the normal recording chain and produced two separate mixes. I ran a mix of just vocals and saxophone out to three channels of the PA for &quot;house&quot; sound. Then I gave my headphones everything. This worked surprisingly well with Presonus's Universal Control. It enables up to 4 mixes, but it's notoriously crash-happy the more you do with it. Thankfully, it held together enough to give me a 3-channel PA routing while recording all 8 channels of audio.</p>\n<p>The bass and keys were easy to record: their amps had DIs and I recorded them direct. I loathe DI'd bass sound most of the time, but a little love from EQ in the mix usually helps and practicality won the day this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mics <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#mics\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For the sax, a Beta 57 positioned a few inches off the bell and at the middle of the horn gave me a surprisingly good sound with minimal effort. I got tonality, articulation, and detailed reediness.</p>\n<p>I stuck a pair of SM81s in an XY pattern over the drummer's head. I was able to get them fairly close, given that he's a jazz drummer with little to no arm swing. The XY of course keeps everything in phase, but it turned out to be a great fit for a unique kit. He uses two snares side by side, and no toms. I supplemented the kit with my old Oktava LDC in the front of the kick. The resulting sound has maybe more room sound than I would care for, and the hats are a bit wild on a couple songs, but it serves the musicality and dynamic range of the jazz style playing.</p>\n<p>The singers each got an SM7B. This is a mic I had no experience with but I was pleased. Though it's a dynamic, it has a lot of detail and really requires a preamp to pull everything out of it. I put it through my cheapo ART Tube MPA preamp (tube-swapped to minimize noise) and my Symetrix 525 compressor/gate. I only took the biggest peaks off; the SM7B's sound is so smooth, it almost sounds like it's been hit with a compressor already. The MC gave a great delivery, and I cranked the tube preamp to give him a touch of grit. I had so much drum bleed in the singer's mic that even the gate wasn't helping. It's possible I should have switched her to a handheld, but even changing her position in the room may have helped. You live and learn. At the end of the day, though, an LDC would never have worked and an SM58 wouldn't have been very exciting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mix\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mix <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#mix\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've been into the idea recently of &quot;console-style&quot; mixing. Initially I tried in the obvious choice, the new (v3) version of <a href=\"http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html\">Harrison Mixbus</a>, but despite some huge improvements in performance it's still not quite ready for primetime. I will continue to experiment with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"slate\" tabindex=\"-1\">Slate <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#slate\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The &quot;console&quot; mentality proved a great way to justify trying out the new Slate subscription plugin program. While Avid is getting a lot of flak for moving to a subscription based model for all versions of Pro Tools going forward, Steven Slate is proving that execution (and a lot of brand good will going into it) can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>The Slate VMR and VCC really tied the sound of all the tracks together, and the 3 EQs (SSL and Neve) and two compressors (Opto and 1176) available in VMR are about what I'd normally use. Since this project wouldn't be mastered, the Slate FG-X would let a non-mastering-engineer like myself put the final touch of volume and polish on the tunes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-plugins\" tabindex=\"-1\">Other Plugins <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#other-plugins\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Despite the closeness of the overheads, I feel like the XY pattern gave me a bit too much room sound and the room really wasn't a great one. So I hit them with a bit of Tokyo Dawn's Proxmity plugin, an ingenious combo of reverb, compression, and EQ that can make sources sit closer or farther away in the mix. For the bass, I shamelessly applied Waves Renaissance Axx compression going into the Slate VMR. Surprisingly, I didn't use the Maag EQ4 on the singer. This had a lot to do with the drum bleed throwing unwanted frequencies into her mic; I needed to do more surgery on specific frequencies. The Maag has smart frequencies but they're fixed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roundup\" tabindex=\"-1\">Roundup <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/live-recording-with-local-band-the-nouns/#roundup\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This was a challenging recording situation. But with the exception of a few specific issues, the mix came together well. So I might have done something right. More than any other session, Shure saved the day. The Beta 57, far from being a &quot;just good enough&quot; versatile mic, was magic on the sax. And I can understand why the SM7B is such a popular microphone. But the stars of the show were really the SM81s. The simple drum mic setup worked great for jazz, and might make me rethink how I deal with a rock kit next time.</p>\n",

Then Gira released a new Angels album with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron/Family\">Akron/Family</a> as the backing band. It's all fairly repetitive and hypnotic compared to earlier Angels of Light records, but &quot;Black River Song&quot; in particular kind of exploded my mind when I heard it. Combined with the cover art by Deryk Thomas, who also painted <em>Love of Life</em> and <em>White Light From The Mouth of Infinity</em> covers, it all added up to Swans. I couldn't stop listening to the tune, and probably telling everyone I knew that this meant Swans were coming back.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4dtWxP8O03qn4yl0P7HXzj\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>At the advent of the Swans reboot, Michael Gira repeatedly told a wonderful yarn. Seth of Akron/Family hit a huge chord on stage and it made Gira realize that he wanted more Swans. But when I listen to this tune, I still feel like it was there, dying to get out. And given that he's done what might be his best stuff since the reboot, I'm pretty glad it was.</p>\n",

Others, like Iron Maiden, keep their old hits from sounding tired by pushing themselves to make great new music. And plenty (Springsteen, the Stones) keep flying by on the strength of their live performance regardless of the weakness of their current output. Kraftwerk manage to grab the best parts of all of these by continually refreshing their classic music.</p>\n<p>We traveled all the way to Detroit for only a long weekend, and it was basically just to see Kraftwerk. How many more tours do Ralf Hutter and the gang have in them? I don't want to be on the wrong end of that question, having never seen them. Pete told me their shows were boring. Kris told me whatever, the visuals are good and you know all the songs. This is pretty right-on. The visuals, this time in 3D, were a fantastic future-retro mix of graphics and video all completely synced with the tunes.</p>\n<p>They started with zero buildup, launching into &quot;Numbers&quot; so fast that much of the theater hadn't gotten seated. They updated the beat that launched a million electro singles into a super powerful, booming dance assault. Apparently Kraftwerk's people enter a venue, evaluate it, and supplement the sound system wherever necessary. And it shows. The sound was powerful but pristine.</p>\n<p>The process of updating the songs began with <em>The Mix</em>, but they now sound even better — the beats have <em>The Mix</em>'s dancefloor focus but the sounds and synths feel more like ultra-high-fidelity versions of the originals.</p>\n<p>Here's a not-great but not-distorted phone clip of &quot;Radioactivity,&quot; possibly the most dramatic update.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9-esZKFVv4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Ironically, the largest response came for the beginning of the second set, &quot;The Robots.&quot; It's ironic because the applause was for the old-school Kraftwerk &quot;robot&quot; mannequins, who took the stage instead of the members. The rest of the time, the group wore uniforms I can only describe as <em>Tron</em>-like, which lit up to correspond with each song's projections.</p>\n<p>Overall, a great show and a great classic Detroit venue to see it. It makes an all-day trek with a near-3-year-old just about worth it.</p>\n",

The song is &quot;Drill,&quot; from <em>The Ideal Copy</em>. It features no less than 9 different reworkings, remixes, and live performances of the song that often bear no resemblance to the original.

      "content_html": "<p>I was somewhat surprised recently to see that some people on the group-buying site Massdrop were attempting to get a group together for the Alesis SR-16 drum machine. At its regular street price, the SR-16 is at the same price point as a lot of other newer, more fashionable machines. The Volca Beats is an insanely fun, great-sounding, compact true analog 808 clone for the same coin. Boss continues to make good drum machines for the same or not much more.</p>\n<p>And recently I've been in multiple conversations about how the Alesis brand is mostly garbage. This is a shame, at least for the sake of a few great machines — The Micron/Ion keyboards are among the best synths to come out of the now-passé virtual analog era — but most notably for the SR-16. It's somewhat hard to love, but it's also hard to deny.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/hr.16.jpg\" alt=\"HR-16\" /></p>\n<p>Alesis produced the very first 16-bit sampling drum machine, the HR-16. Previous sample-based machines, like Oberheim's DMX and the Linn LM-1, were 8 or 12-bit. &quot;HR&quot; stood for high resolution and it really wasn't a pose. The samples were good, they had multiple velocity levels, and they were tunable. But there was, as with all machines of the time, a single kit worth of sounds to choose from. I use one, and I replaced the internal chips with Linn LM-1 sounds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/sr.16.jpg\" alt=\"SR-16\" /></p>\n<p>Fast forward to 1993, and the successor to the HR-16 didn't do much for innovation, but it added every feature you might want in a drum machine. There were velocity-dependent samples: if you hit a pad harder you'd hear a sample of a drummer hitting the drum harder, rather than just the same sample at higher volume. There were two drum &quot;fills&quot; for each pattern, so that switching between patterns was less robotic and more realistic. For live standalone users, there were two foot pedal inputs for changing patterns hands-free on stage. But if you wanted to use the unit as a sound module, the MIDI implementation was more complete than anything on the market. Godflesh upgraded their HR-16 to an SR-16, and I started playing fairly Godflesh-like music with one, recording my ideas to 4-track. It also powered my first industrial/experimental band for quite a while before finally giving up the ghost after about 10 years of beats (I still have it and I'm sure it could be made operational again). But as long as it lasted and as useful as it was, I'm surprised that it's still made. More power to it.</p>\n",

Fortunately, Kirby is a flat-file system that allows users to add content by simply uploading it. So now I'm blogging locally in my favorite Markdown editor and distraction-free writing tool, <a href=\"http://bywordapp.com/\">Byword</a>.

I love it, although it's not always intuitive how to do what you need. Essentially this workflow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Asks for a name that will eventually be the permalink of the Kirby post</li>\n<li>Creates a folder in my local &quot;blog&quot; folder with that title</li>\n<li>Copies a text file template into that folder with the name <code>article.txt</code> (which is what Kirby needs to associate it with the &quot;article&quot; template</li>\n<li>Opens that file in Byword, where I can fill it out</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once I write the post, the second part comes into play.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dropzone\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dropzone <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/enhancing-kirby-with-local-workflows/#dropzone\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/\">Dropzone 3.5</a> was recently released, and it's a nice update to a super useful program. Imagine internet (not just web) bookmarks, file actions, and shortcuts, all rolled into one simple place. You can click actions or drag files and folders onto them, depending on what they are. So in order to publish a post, I just take the newly created folder and drag it onto an FTP shortcut I made in Dropzone. Bam, blogged. And I never have to write anything into another web interface again if I don't want to. Thanks to Kirby's self-contained content style, I can put any images for the post into that folder and they'll work as well.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, I added the Automator action to Dropzone as well so I can both write and upload the post from Dropzone. It's a handy little tool that's a good buy at 5 bucks. Only downside I've encountered so far is that it can't upload folders to an S3 bucket.</p>\n",

It was too small, a little persnickity, and basically had one temperature (&quot;hot as it'll go,&quot; which was increasingly &quot;not that hot&quot;).</p>\n<p>After doing some online reading and talking to a couple people, I came to the Kamado style grill and ended up with the Char-Griller Akorn. Last year's model was dirt cheap on Amazon and Prime-ready, so in a day I was up and running. The chief appeal of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamado\">kamado</a>, popularized in the West by the Big Green Egg, is that you can get crazy hot with it but also control super low temperatures for long periods. So it lends itself not only to making a pizza with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35P2wTX0zg\">super hot fire</a> but smoking a brisket.</p>\n<p>For the Fourth, I brought some smoked stuff to the neighbors' party — he's a carne asada connoisseur, but she's a vegetarian. So I took it upon myself to see if Real Texas Flavor could be transferred to a mouth without riding on a dead animal.</p>\n<p>I read a bit online but not many people were doing it. <a href=\"http://jasonhardin.com/smoking-tofu/\">This person</a> gave me the marinade idea: basically one part rice wine vinegar to two parts soy sauce. As meat eaters who've tried it will attest, tofu doesn't really have a lot of flavor. So slicing the bricks lengthwise in half then marinating them for about a day in this salty/tangy, vaguely Japanese solution gave it a great savory start before it even hit the wood. After that, I got the hickory going as low as it would go, waited for the good thin blue smoke (you do that, don't you? Don't tell me you cook over that white shit), and sat the half-bricks down for about 2 hours.</p>\n<p>True to what I expected, they gained a little more chew. I'm not sure where that comes from, but if you've ever had smoked cheese you know what I'm talking about. A little rind, a little denser texture. In the case of spongey-ass tofu, it worked well. It had the texture of tofu that'd been pressed for weeks, not the couple hours I did it.</p>\n<p>Results? I loved it, both neighbors loved it, a few people declared it the best tofu they'd ever had. And it really did have a taste reminiscent of Texas BBQ.</p>\n",

It had great features for photographers and retouchers, great features for graphic designers, great features for UI designers, and all that adds up to &quot;too many features.&quot; No one person is likely to use everything that Photoshop offers anymore. So we're left with feature weight, function weight, and interface weight, while upstarts like Sketch barrel in with a limited toolset and huge efficiency of performance and UI. Design Spaces appear to directly acknowledge and address this problem.</p>\n<p>Vinh is wrong about one thing though:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What strikes me about this situation is how remarkable it is that it exists at all; the Adobe of a decade ago seemed to have little or no interest in what was important to web and interface designers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Adobe of a decade ago was still putting resources into Fireworks, the wellspring of all these screen design tools.

R.I.O. were progressive rock bands from England and Europe who packed so much complexity into their music that the standard prog fans wouldn’t touch them. Their audience consisted of avant weirdos, industrial heads, and fans of more experimental stuff, and their membership was as varied as Henry Cow and This Heat.</p>\n<p>Belgian chamber rock band Univers Zero were one of the most intense R.I.O. groups, and Heresie is the best and darkest of their work.

It was, all in all, a great thing to do.</p>\n<p>Life since the move is mostly an endless series of boxes, but I have managed to get myself embroiled in one of the weirdest artistic situations of my almost 20 years of playing music.</p>\n<p>I'd seen the Make-A-Band posters around town but hadn't really given much thought to what it even was. Erika saw an ad in the Eugene Weekly and convinced me that I was sufficiently musical and lacking in dignity to do it. So what <em>is</em> it? Basically, a bunch of musicians audition for 6 producers, who pick them to form 6 bands. The bands then perform in a competition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/1429200952940.jpg\" alt=\"Make-A-Band Poster\" /></p>\n<p>The producers are local studio owners, record engineers, and (in the case of the ones who picked me) people in the business of video game scoring. The auditions are 3 minutes. And the competition is downtown, outdoors, for the whole damn ass world to see.</p>\n<p>Even with Sharks, I don't feel like I ever took traditional, above-ground routes to musical performance and networking. It was always the DIY, punk rock thing — which of course in Austin is the only way anybody manages because it's a &quot;who you know&quot; situation and I've rarely known anything or anybody. But regardless of how this thing turns out, I've met some like-minded people and many of the folks making the Eugene music scene tick.</p>\n<p>So here's the band, Gravity Nocturne. We're doing a jazzy, updated take on trip-hop. We're also all like 21, except me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/gravity.nocturne-v1.jpg\" alt=\"Gravity Nocturne\" /></p>\n<p>Don't worry, I'll be back to playing for nobody soon.</p>\n",

For me, it's <em>less is more</em>: less options, less possibilities to twiddle, and less graphical EQ curves.

But it sounds great, is easy to use, and doesn't hit your processor hard. So really, it's safe to put on just about everything. Its bands are hard to read (Why is it &quot;.10kHz&quot; instead of &quot;100Hz&quot;?), but they're highly controllable. So you can do both broad strokes and somewhat detailed surgery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"waves-api-560\" tabindex=\"-1\">Waves API 560 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-api-560\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Under ideal cirumstances I'd have the whole Waves API 500 series bundle, but this one went on sale. It's fun to have a graphic EQ sometimes, especially one with only a few bands. It sounds great on a wide variety of sources too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"waves-scheps-76\" tabindex=\"-1\">Waves Scheps 76 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-scheps-76\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Another modeler, this one after a console. The gimmick is the integrated preamp. The bands aren't fixed on this EQ but the knobs have huge steps so you can only dial in a few possible frequencies each. The Qs are not variable. It sounds great on drums, especially kicks. Given those few bands, it's easy to crank the 60Hz and then throw one on the bass and drop the 60Hz there so they don't fight. The preamp section can add smooth overdrive to the bass as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maag-eq4\" tabindex=\"-1\">Maag EQ4 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#maag-eq4\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>An incredible EQ. It's got four fixed bands, a fixed Q, and some frankly weird frequency choices. But those bands were supposedly picked to cause the least amount of phase effects. It sounds absolutely magical. It's possible I bought into the hype with this one, but I got a deal and I can't say I feel any regret. I do feel almost guilty using it though; it requires barely any thought to make vocals, acoustic guitars, and even some drums sound amazing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nomad-factory-pulsetec\" tabindex=\"-1\">Nomad Factory PulseTec <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#nomad-factory-pulsetec\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Nomad Factory is the Rodney Dangerfield of plugin companies. I'm not sure if this thing sounds remotely like a real Pultec but it goes on all my master busses. It was completely bonkers to me at first to be able to simultaneously boost and cut the same frequencies, but man it does the trick. Not great on the top end (the Maag can handle that), but it thickens and tightens mids and low-mids.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tokyo-dawn-labs-slickeq\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tokyo Dawn Labs SlickEQ <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#tokyo-dawn-labs-slickeq\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Another super transparent phase-free EQ, but this one is geared toward the master buss and costs nothing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dynamics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dynamics <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#dynamics\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"waves-cla-76\" tabindex=\"-1\">Waves CLA-76 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-cla-76\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I waited a great long while for this to go on sale. I've always wanted an 1176 that wasn't the Bomb Factory BF76 that comes with Pro Tools. It's everything I wanted it to be and I use it everywhere — primarily drums but it'll tame a problematic source quickly and with character. At its full price, it probably still wouldn't be bad.</p>\n<h3 id=\"waves-renaissance-axx\" tabindex=\"-1\">Waves Renaissance Axx <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#waves-renaissance-axx\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I wonder how many people use this thing. I mean, everyone's got the Native Power Pack, right? But Renaissance Axx is one of those tools that feels like cheating. Just slide the threshold down and watch it magically even out guitars and basses. It uses so little processor I get pretty generous slapping it on guitar tracks. I've heard a few pros cop to using this thing and why the hell not?</p>\n<h3 id=\"t-racks-opto-compressor\" tabindex=\"-1\">T-Racks Opto Compressor <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#t-racks-opto-compressor\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>IK Multimedia is another company that gets a lot of poop from people. But I've had their opto compressor for a long time and it's one of my favorite tools for vocals. It can open up a weak track by an inexperienced vocalist who's all over the place or who didn't project. You can get miles of compression out of the thing with much more transparency than an 1176. Sometimes I'll double a difficult vocalist's track, overdrive it, crank the mids and highs with a smooth EQ like the Maag, and then flatten it out with this compressor. Mixing in a little bit of that adds presence and is probably a super old trick not worth mentioning. But this is a good comp to do it with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tokyo-dawn-labs-kotelnikov\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tokyo Dawn Labs Kotelnikov <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#tokyo-dawn-labs-kotelnikov\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm still learning this feedback compressor, but it's smooth and transparent. You almost have to watch the meters to see that it's compressing, but it can make the master buss sound great. And though you can spring for the &quot;Gentlemen's Edition&quot; (?), the basic version is super great and costs zero dollars.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ddmf-the-strip\" tabindex=\"-1\">DDMF The Strip <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#ddmf-the-strip\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is actually a full channel strip so it's both and EQ and compressor, in switchable order. It has a Neve look and that's the starting point for the modeling. But this amazing plug goes a little farther into original territory than most models. DDMF is one of the few developers who can get away with charging next to nothing for plugins yet still get respect from GearSlutz. I got it for $30 as a launch special and I'm crazy impressed. Even the knob motion reveals just how much thought went into this. The developer is also a mixer, and it shows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flux-bittersweet\" tabindex=\"-1\">Flux Bittersweet <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#flux-bittersweet\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Sometimes you need simple transient shaping that'll get the job done without interfering with other dynamics processing. How's one knob? How's free? It sounds nice too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-stuff\" tabindex=\"-1\">Other Stuff <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#other-stuff\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"blue-cat-patchwork\" tabindex=\"-1\">Blue Cat Patchwork <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-mixing-plugins-2015/#blue-cat-patchwork\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The Blue Cat folks make some great stuff.

I'm not here to provide better solutions for them, but I will say that in many cases, they're not really problems at all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-global-namespace\" tabindex=\"-1\">1. Global Namespace <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#1-global-namespace\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Firstly, I think this is key to illustrating why a developer of vjeux's caliber can have a great thought process but miss the boat to some degree on CSS. He calls a class a &quot;global variable.&quot; This seems at first like a matter of introducing programming semantics into the conversation so we all know what we're talking about, but I think it's conflating what a <em>class</em> and a <em>variable</em> actually are. The word itself indicates that the value of a variable can change — if anything, a CSS class is a constant. It's simply a pointer or reference. If you prefer, a class or ID selector is a set of rules more akin to a function (or, in OO, a <em>class</em>... probably no coincidence there).</p>\n<p>But getting away from a concept I honestly feel somewhat inadequately equipped to really talk about at length, the &quot;namespace&quot; issue itself is the first of these that isn't really an issue. A class living on its own, even one attached to an element (e.g., <code>div.myclass</code>), does inhabit a &quot;global&quot; namespace in the sense that you can use that class anywhere with no limitations. Only good practice will limit you. But writing self-contained rules is not incredibly hard, is it? Take this piece of LESS (roughly identical in SCSS):</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.specific-container</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token selector\">input.super-specific-input</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token comment\">/* style rules */</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br />  <span class=\"token selector\">label.super-specific-label</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token comment\">/* style rules */</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>In the sense that <code>.specific-container</code> is available to use and abuse anywhere, it is a &quot;global&quot; element. But that class in itself becomes an effective namespace for anything within it. And a few simple naming conventions can take that further.</p>\n<p>I can barely think straight to comment on these (literally) backwards extensions that the Facebook team apparently wrote before arriving at the conclusion that they should abandon CSS altogether.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-dependencies\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Dependencies <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#2-dependencies\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm not entirely sure I understood this section, mostly because the expectations of CSS working like a build process (i.e., errors should cause everything to break) is such a foreign concept to me.</p>\n<p>Maintainability and monitoring the Cascade used to be a huge issue with CSS. This is something that preprocessors have solved incredibly well, even though they don't change many fundamental aspects of CSS. That includes the Cascade itself, but one of Less's early counterarguments was that the ability to write such modular CSS discourage &quot;proper&quot; or <em>cascading</em> use of styles. I'm not exactly pedantic on that myself, but if one were so inclined to write completely modular Less/Sass with no globally-impacting styles and no large-scale cascading, it's not very hard to do. Basically the above example, repeated numerous times as separate files and associated with each module or UI component, <em>becomes</em> a set of dependencies. These are easily managed by Less/Sass imports.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-dead-code-elimination\" tabindex=\"-1\">3. Dead Code Elimination <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#3-dead-code-elimination\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Near as I can tell, what they're referring to as &quot;dead code elimination&quot; is a product of their own solution. I can't really speak to this.</p>\n<p>What I can say is that poorly-maintained, long-running, legacy CSS (the old way, without the concatenation made possible from preprocessors) is a problem for a lot of people. This is not a fault of the language itself. Less/Sass certainly make it easier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-minification\" tabindex=\"-1\">4. Minification <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#4-minification\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Maybe someone can help me here, but I'm confused about this one — the old, extended-CSS solution let Facebook's developers use incredibly weird, non-semantic, but very short class names in order to save a couple bytes. It's bizarre but has its logic. So how does programmatically replacing a token with a long list of inline styles — which are maintained as a single component but echoed into a page once for every instance — save bytes? Not sure. If semantic class selectors is a problem of byte size, that's fine, but I don't think it's one that huge, redundant inline styles can solve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-sharing-constants\" tabindex=\"-1\">5. Sharing Constants <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#5-sharing-constants\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>What's the old quote? There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things. Making your stuff sync up between content, presentation, and behavior is a problem old as the hills, but most teams don't have the specific problem in this deck because they're not working with this weird system.</p>\n<p>What vjeux shows here is a worst-of-both-worlds scenario where style has been mixed into behavior, but not all the way. I would argue that yes, in fact, his completely inline solution is a better answer than the hodgepodge here.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> buttonPadding <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>Reading that physically hurt me. He says &quot;unfortunately there are many real world use cases where you need to do it.&quot; Not sure I buy that. If you really, <em>really</em> feel this need, there are tools for your Grunt or Gulp file that will transform a list of Less/Sass variables into Javascript at build time and thus keep the values synced automatically.</p>\n<p>Upon reading the solution they developed, I got pretty confused at &quot;CSS Variables.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-non-deterministic-resolution\" tabindex=\"-1\">6. Non-deterministic Resolution <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#6-non-deterministic-resolution\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is another case of holding CSS to the same standards of behavior as a logical programming language, which it is not. The &quot;linear&quot; flow of later rules overriding earlier ones is always something that programmers struggle with because they can't organize things according to how they like; <strong>they must organize according to how the web browser is going to read the document</strong>.</p>\n<p>Writing with the modular, &quot;namespaced&quot; blocks of Less/Sass eases these problems in two ways: one, confining the rules to their own pocket of markup will keep them from affecting anything else in the application, and two, the ease of auditing the styles will prevent unexpected cascades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-breaking-isolation\" tabindex=\"-1\">7. Breaking Isolation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#7-breaking-isolation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I feel sad for the team at Facebook who've been burned by a poor understanding and even poorer practices of CSS writing. Overriding in the way shown in the example is unfortunate. But imagining myself as a designer in that organization, forced to think in an upside down way about my CSS, it kinda feels like it's no wonder the designers reach for non-ideal solutions as long as they <em>work</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"my-problems-with-the-solution\" tabindex=\"-1\">My Problems with the Solution <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#my-problems-with-the-solution\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I can certainly see the appeal of just styling within the component as Javascript. The author does fall into a pattern that is common among devs (I've done it too): a post-hoc justification.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Second, style is actually a much better name than class. You want to &quot;style&quot; the element, not &quot;class&quot; it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's not bring the semantics into it — I get that the actual english <em>words</em> make more sense, but we've all agreed on what that word means in the context of markup. This is a side point though.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-redundant-bytes-and-information\" tabindex=\"-1\">1. Redundant bytes and information <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#1-redundant-bytes-and-information\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Whether you're talking in terms of human readability or the space taken on disk/downloaded over the internet, I have to question whether multiple references to a single CSS class:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.btnClass</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> #333<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">border-radius</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 2px<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> #fff<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>is not preferable to</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\"token special-attr\"><span class=\"token attr-name\">style</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token value css language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>#333<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><span class=\"token property\">border-radius</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>2px<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>#fff</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>One button<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>repeated over and over throughout the application. And here of course I'm using a very simple example; most real-world CSS rules are going to be <em>significantly larger</em>. This is one of those questions that I assume has been empirically answered, but there isn't a lot of usage of this method going around yet, so I don't know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-separation-of-concerns\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Separation of Concerns <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#2-separation-of-concerns\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I get the very real benefits in React of mixing concerns while separating physical application pieces. Everything associated with this piece (structure, style, behavior) is in one place, so I know exactly what needs to be done in order to make a change to that piece.</p>\n<p>But part of the benefit of the classic &quot;separation of concerns&quot; philosophy is the ability to take a holistic look at the styles. For all the supposed solutions with regard to maintenance and dead code elimination, I'm afraid this has created many more potential ones. Obviously, this is to some degree going to be dependent on how a React application is structured, but components can't truly share stylistic elements, even if they have individual styles in common. So the ability to change that stylistic element from a central place is now lost.</p>\n<p>The best we can really do with this method is reference a central variable, or possibly (I'm not even sure about this) something like a mixin. Like any of the CSS-based solutions that vjeux writes off as non-enforceable, this requires good practice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-separation-of-work\" tabindex=\"-1\">3. Separation of Work <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#3-separation-of-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>vjeux himself admits that part of the motivation for Facebook's crazed bolting on to CSS is due to having a large team of developers working on highly focused portions of code, most with limited expertise in front end. This is, let's be frank, not an uncommon problem but it is a specific one.</p>\n<p>Though tools like KSS have been around for a while, style-guide-based development is just now coming into its own. Mailchimp, Starbucks, Lonely Planet and others have made huge and very public strides in building component libraries that developers can then reference and drop into new pages.</p>\n<p>The benefits are easy to see: a streamlined design process, easy enforcement of standards, and a refocused approach that encourages solving problems with the same design patterns where possible.</p>\n<p>With all styles inside the React components, control over front end is not only not handled holistically, it is handled entirely by developers who may or may not have much expertise with browser discrepancies, best practices, and all the other myriad of things that CSS writers actually focus their time on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-missing-features\" tabindex=\"-1\">4. Missing Features <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#4-missing-features\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Generated content and other pseudo-class selectors are pretty much not available here. Is it overkill to impose a hover state just for a color? Perhaps not with React, whose bread and butter is state change.</p>\n<p>And what about media queries? This is beyond unfortunate:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/mediaqueries.png\" alt=\"Not the best Responsive Design\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"toward-a-better-way\" tabindex=\"-1\">Toward a better way <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/seven-sins-of-css/#toward-a-better-way\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>These are all fairly new issues. vjeux's still giving this presentation, and it only went online in November. React developers are still discovering the process and trying it on. The argument on Hacker News is still somewhat active.</p>\n<p>My problem is not with upending dominant paradigms. It's not with trying to find new ways of styling. But ditching most of the primary benefits of CSS/Less/Sass and justifying that with arguments based on some inaccurate assumptions is a paradigm shift that doesn't quite feel necessary.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I spent 7 years in Pittsburgh, another in Detroit, and now just shy of 7 years I'm leaving Austin. That's as lucky a number as any, although it feels like an incredibly short time in a city that grows and changes as rapidly as this one. But ultimately, the exciting stuff in this town suits young people who go out a lot, tech-libertarians, people who aren't yet sick of Texas's inability to &quot;do&quot; public transit, and the sort of day drinkers who've always occupied the Town of Linklater Films.</p>\n<p>At least, I'll probably continue telling myself that indefinitely.</p>\n<p>But there's a lot of truth there — it really is tough when you have a young child to even imagine enjoying the fruits of a town known for its nightlife, and eventually you start to wonder if that's really for you anymore. As a musician, it's hard to always play for nobody or to keep pace with the younger, better looking indie-poppers filling up the increasingly snobby and hard-to-book venues. As a person who tries to have some perspective, sometimes taking a step back you realize how much <strong>Austin is clinging to its fun slacker persona, even as it gets big enough that it really could stand to clean up its act maybe just a little before it loses everything that people love about it</strong>.</p>\n<p>This isn't about how &quot;Austin has changed, man&quot;; That was old even when I moved here. Of course places change and that's part of what makes a town ok to continue living in more than 7 years. But I'm not a lone wolf slacker musician, I'm now some kind of &quot;family man&quot; (imposter syndrome doesn't just work at your job) and that is a super rewarding part of my life that's taking me away from the both the eye-rolling mustachioed coolness I'm so over and the merciless, dash-cracking sunshine I love so much. So yeah, there is a flipside.</p>\n<p>I wasn't too great at making friends until moving here. I've become more social and worked in an office again, so I'm leaving behind maybe the closest, coolest bunch of people ever — people who, I'd like to think, &quot;get&quot; me.</p>\n<p>I'm not exactly headed to unstable territory now, but if I'm being real it's difficult to leave behind 75-degree winters, constant restaurant openings, or that slight swell of pride when even a big city slicker's eyes brighten at the mention of where you live. It's even harder to leave those friends I've worked with, played music with, or lived next to. Having them all gather at a party for us yesterday was beyond cool — it was downright humbling that that many people care enough (A friend called the beautiful weather &quot;one last kick in the nuts&quot;).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/party.jpg\" alt=\"party\" /></p>\n<p>Now... It's not in the least bit hard to leave constant traffic, lines to sit in literally every one of those restaurants, or the Texas government, none of which are gonna go anywhere anytime soon. And I could do without the hypocritical faux-liberals who nod sagely about how we need affordable housing and mass transit, but then get all predictably NIMBY when it comes time to do something. <strong>UPDATE IN 2024: OH NO EUGENE</strong></p>\n<p>But rather than dwell on what great things I'm leaving or bemoan the bad ones, I think it'd be more productive to commit yesterday's laughs and hugs to memory, give thanks for the all that's happened to me here, and think of what other positive stuff lies ahead.</p>\n<p>I know I'm going to a culturally rich, meteorogically mild place with incredibly friendly people, and my new commute is going to add hours to my week (time) and probably years to my life (I-35 stress). But that's just the beginning. Now that I'm a little better at life than I was seven years ago, my hope is that I can create an even more amazing one there.</p>\n<p>If this is me in the &quot;Before&quot; picture, look for the &quot;After&quot; soon. And at least check out my Instagrams from the road.</p>\n",

It's a varied, rich, and constantly surprising piece of work, and it has Thor Harris on it too!</p>\n<h2 id=\"st-vincent\" tabindex=\"-1\">St. Vincent <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#st-vincent\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've seen St. Vincent, and I've heard pretty much all of her albums, but this was the first one to really catch my ear. This is the kind of art rock that people like Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush used to do — accessible but genuinely attempting to go places. She's also the kind of guitar player who's super talented but intriguing, not shreddy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/soused.jpg\" alt=\"Soused\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"scott-walker-and-sunno-soused\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scott Walker and SunnO)))  - Soused <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#scott-walker-and-sunno-soused\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As Scott Walker gets increasingly prolific in his old age, it's starting to be apparent that he's actually got a pretty in-tune sense of humor. On paper, Walker with Sunn is the Lou Reed/Metallica album that actually <em>works</em>. In practice, it's basically a Scott Walker album with guitars, and that's just fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swans-to-be-kind\" tabindex=\"-1\">SWANS - To Be Kind <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#swans-to-be-kind\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Seer was maybe the peak of Gira's output, ever. It was the realization of the promise that <em>Swans are Dead</em> teased us with just before he originally disbanded the group. The only thing wrong with <em>To Be Kind</em> is that it's not <em>The Seer.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"sumerian-fleet-just-pressure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sumerian Fleet - Just Pressure <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#sumerian-fleet-just-pressure\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I basically kind of started following Dark Entries records around the time I got super into the Minimal Wave catalog as well. That led me to their flagship release of 2014. This retro slice of Linn-driven heavy old-school EBM meets sparse synth-wave makes me think of the best of early 242, and it's immaculately produced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"run-the-jewels-2\" tabindex=\"-1\">Run the Jewels 2 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#run-the-jewels-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It topped a lot of the pros' lists, and it's probably obvious why. The first RTJ was a cool side project, but the real potential of an El-P/Killer Mike collaboration opened up on the second one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blxpltn-black-cop-down\" tabindex=\"-1\">BLXPLTN - Black Cop Down <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#blxpltn-black-cop-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is one of Austin's most exciting local bands, but they're not going to get the press that the mellower or more rockist indie groups will. They're a hardcore band with a drum pad. What a weird thing, but they're so fierce, catchy, and fist-in-the-air angry it's hard to deny the live show or the record.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/undercolor.jpg\" alt=\"Under Color of Official Right\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"protomartyr-under-color-of-official-right\" tabindex=\"-1\">Protomartyr - Under Color of Official Right <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#protomartyr-under-color-of-official-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The first Protomartyr album was kind of out of nowhere, and doing the jagged Fall-inspired post-punk thing in Detroit is unexpected. But the production is better, the songs are tighter and darker, and Joe Casey's incredible lyrics are more audible on the second one. It's a mix of a realistic portrait of alcoholic depression, a lament for Detroit, and what Casey calls &quot;bad dad songs&quot; (one of which, &quot;Bad Advice,&quot; is about Kwame). This, from &quot;I Stare At Floors,&quot; sums up well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The day comes<br />\nsame as before<br />\nit goes on again<br />\nthe television a concave window<br />\nlawyers and murderers<br />\nthe Law's confusing, the Order makes no sense</em><br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Scratching the skin<br />\nStaring at walls, staring at floors<br />\nThe plan today is not to die<br />\nThe cure-all's always over ice</em><br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I listened to it every day for like 3 months and still can't get enough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-stuff\" tabindex=\"-1\">Other stuff <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#other-stuff\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Fennesz, Aphex Twin, The Bug, FKA Twigs, and of course Shellac all put out solid albums this year that I enjoyed a lot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"honorable-mention-from-2013\" tabindex=\"-1\">Honorable Mention from 2013 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/favorite-albums-2014/#honorable-mention-from-2013\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Speaking of Minimal Wave, I also discovered Veronica Vasik's sub-label Cititrax and the act Kontravoid. He apparently used to be the live drummer for Crystal Castles but in any case his self-titled dark synthpop LP from 2013 got a lot of play from me as well.</p>\n",

You wouldn’t think this would bother anyone: sure, they took a long time to load and were really awful quality purplish GIFs for a long time, but being able to navigate around a web page with your mouse and scrollbar really opened up the web to a lot of people who would never have touched the green-on-black terminal browser Lynx.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/mosaic.jpg\" alt=\"Mosaic\" /></p>\n<p>Still, there were casualties: the early denizens of the internet, the super tech-savvy terminal jockeys and ASCII artists who preferred the music of a ker-chunking <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard\">IBM Model M keyboard</a> to the click of a mouse saw their little private utopia being taken away. In a way, I can sympathize. They were probably worried it’d be filled with n00bs, dads and ads eventually.</p>\n<p>But the lesson is there. Adapt or get left behind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-blue-beanie\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Blue Beanie <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/#the-blue-beanie\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Most of these revolutions have happened during my career. The rise and fall of Flash, the advent of YouTube, blogging… it’s been a fun ride so far.</p>\n<p>But from a designer/developer standpoint, something that in hindsight might’ve had the biggest effect was the Web Standards movement. As late as the mid–2000s, we’d been designing pages based on some anonymous genius’s realization that HTML tables and weirdly sliced images could be used to create print-like layouts on web pages. Thus the business of “web design.” But this was a hack, and it helped us grow an appetite for hacks. Meanwhile, Netscape and Microsoft were vying for supremacy in the browser market by adding more and more amazing but completely incompatible features. So we essentially had to build sites twice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mikepropst.com/img/zeldman.jpg\" alt=\"zeldman\" /></p>\n<p>But then <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-06/jeffrey-zeldman-king-of-web-standardsbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice\">Jeffrey Zeldman came along</a> and told us all to try something: first off, stop using tables, because we’re hacking a useful feature of the browser to do something awful it wasn’t meant to do, and second, stop using these browsers’ non-standard features. Start using CSS. Thus the <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">Web Standards Project</a> (and what has come to be called the web standards movement) was born. And this movement effectively ended those dreaded Browser Wars.</p>\n<p>Trust me, we’re all better for it. But for a while, there were a lot of designers and developers who didn’t want to abandon their fancy browser features, and didn’t want to stop using tables because <em>they worked!</em> Those people adapted. Or they became irrelevant once the browser makers got on board with the Standards crowd.</p>\n<h2 id=\"responding-to-change\" tabindex=\"-1\">Responding to Change <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/change/#responding-to-change\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The arrival of web applications was not about just one thing. Faster broadband, AJAX, browsers able to run complex Javascript, web fonts, SVG, and all kinds of other stuff made the web the new platform for software. It’s still getting better. And our desktop computers aren’t the only devices with these front-end capabilities anymore. If I can get my software over the web, and my phone has a really good web browser, I should be able to run the software on my phone, right?</p>\n<p>Ethan Marcotte first coined the term “Responsive Web Design” <a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design\">four years ago on <em>A List Apart</em></a>, and the design world has been pretty… responsive to it. Rather than the conversations I used to have ten years ago over whether we’re going to finally support 1024x768 screens, applications can now resize, reflow, and customize for different screens and devices. It’s a huge change in a way of thinking, but it’s also one more way that web applications are now more like “real” applications: do Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop force me into a highly controlled layout that only works at a certain window size?</p>\n<p>But like the ASCII art and table layouts, there are going to be some casualties in the new way. I think the concept of “pixel perfection” is one of those. If my application changes from screen to screen and situation to situation, I can’t ever know <em>exactly</em> what it’s going to look like to any particular customer.</p>\n<p>And that’s fine.</p>\n<p>There’s still room for all the careful and highly thought out work that we’ve always done when crafting web pages and web applications. In fact, our job is more important than ever because there’s no way a print layout designer can ever do what we do: deliver what our customers need, on whatever device they need it. And we don’t have any intention of being left behind.</p>\n",

Using table display moves the Holy Grail Layout from hacky and difficult to done in a couple lines of CSS.</p>\n<p>One thing the article mentions is source order. The author kind of waves this away as an SEO concern, but I'd argue it's the single biggest issue holding back even the people who aren't skeeved out by the word &quot;table.&quot; Source order used to matter little to me; I also thought it was pretty much an SEO issue, or possibly a tweak to page rendering speed at best, but in this day and age? It's easy to move stuff horizontally with floats, but stacked boxes in a mobile layout really need the source order you want to appear on screen. Which, conveniently, is probably the most sensical source order. And if your table layout doesn't support that, you might have created some real headaches for yourself in a responsive page or screen.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, I've just started playing with <code>display:table</code> in earnest on some sites and I'm experiencing some strange behavior with regard to showing and hiding elements. This is further compounded by shifting breakpoints as you resize the browser.</p>\n<p>There's a couple schools of thought on that, both of which I've belonged to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The diligent front end devs who will make sure that they've fixed every little weird issue. This is probably the &quot;right&quot; school to be in.</li>\n<li>The pragmatic but perhaps somewhat lazy approach says &quot;only designers sit and resize their browsers all day long making sure all the breakpoints work.&quot; We're designing for multiple devices and screen sizes, not constantly shifting screen sizes. Probably. And the major layout shift where the bug happens is at a small enough size that you probably won't see it on desktop browser at all, where resizing is possible. Probably.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The thing of responsive layout is that it's an admission we don't <em>know</em> all the cases. So knowingly leaving a weird situation in there without making a pretty significant effort to fix it is a disingenuous move. Hopefully I'll make progress on it, and if I do, I'll document it here.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I've finally taken my first step into the wide world of yesterday's favorite web technology with a new understanding of Grunt. <strong>UPDATE: It wasn't long before I moved to Gulp. Welp.</strong></p>\n<p>It's par for the course that designers and front end devs are trendy, fad-prone folks with their eye to the future and an almost obsessive-compulsive desire to find the &quot;perfect&quot; set of tools or processes. And by now, many (especially the ones prone to blog posts) have moved past Grunt to another Javascript/Node-based system called Gulp.</p>\n<p>I'm not there.</p>\n<p>I love being hip and with the times too — I have a Ghost blog. But having just discovered enough information about Grunt from ebooks, coworkers, and Stack Overflow threads to be dangerous, I'm not about to move on just yet. And now that I &quot;get it,&quot; I have to say that maybe it <em>is</em> kind of the &quot;perfect&quot; tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-will-make-grunt-resilient-in-the-long-run\" tabindex=\"-1\">What will make Grunt resilient in the long run? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/#what-will-make-grunt-resilient-in-the-long-run\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The &quot;perfection&quot; of Grunt is not about its extreme levels of functionality, nor its user-friendliness (lol). It's the flexibility. Grunt serves that obsessive-compulsive tool-design side of front end with a lot of plugins and an easy way to write more. If you're a FED and you really need something that isn't in the Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, then maybe you should consider taking your skills to the node-module-writing level.</p>\n<p>It's also super portable, which makes creating an environment a snap — just install Node, and you can run Grunt-powered sites and apps. I've heard opposing arguments on whether to put your Node modules for an app or site into Git, but right now we're not. Any new environment just needs to run <code>npm install</code> and they're up and running. It's literally that easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-we-doing-with-it\" tabindex=\"-1\">What are we doing with it? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/#what-are-we-doing-with-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Currently I'm working on a static prototype with bootstrap (LESS version), JQuery, and a few charting libraries. Grunt moves static files from a <code>src</code> to <code>dist</code> directory, minifies Javascript, compiles LESS files and Jade templates, and runs <a href=\"http://www.browsersync.io/\">Browsersync</a> for live reloading and injection. When we're all synced up, it also deploys to Amazon S3 for the stakeholders to view live.</p>\n<p>This is a relatively simple setup for Grunt, which can do all kinds of more Node apps and complex whosamawhatsits. But it's the right tool for the job when compared to something like Preproc or CodeKit which, don't get me wrong, are nice apps.</p>\n<p>For instance, I nailed down the file structure early and defined it in the Jade compiler. Now every new Jade template added automatically compiles to an HTML file in the right structure. CodeKit requires me to define the path of every new template.</p>\n<p>Grunt also lets you create multiple setups. For instance, in development, the watcher and compiler might not minify the final Javascript and CSS so they're more easily debugged in the browser. But on deploy, minify it all. And this is all a one-time setup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downsides\" tabindex=\"-1\">Downsides <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/grunt/#downsides\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>That one-time setup is pretty much Grunt's big downside. The syntax is a bit arcane to me, not quite resembling any normal Javascript or JSON files. Installing packages is a breeze with NPM, but actually setting up the tasks and getting them to do what you want can be a many-hour process.</p>\n<p>Now, is that worth the flexibility and other advantages it offers over simpler GUI compiler applications? Depends on your use case, I'd guess. For us, it's really fantastic. I still use CodeKit on some other sites, and I'm sure the daunting setup process will keep me away a few times that I might prefer using Grunt.</p>\n<p>But overall, it's been fun to learn and satisfying to set up a workflow exactly how I want. That might make me a fad-chasing Kool-Aid drinker but I'm happy to never struggle with my tools not doing what I want.</p>\n",

This is where the audience's ignorance really pays off. Fall Out Boy is an American pop-punk band formed in 2001 (that's working on 15 years ago, kids) who helped bring pop-punk/pop-emo from the 90s style into the 2000s. They are highly influential and though I can't stand to listen to 5 seconds of them, you don't need a degree in Telling Death Metal Bands apart to know that they don't sound anything like One Direction, a boy group from England who don't write songs and don't really have guitar parts for these straw-students to learn. Comparing the two, at any rate, is the purview of YouTube comments, not kids who want to learn to play music.</li>\n<li><strong>Bon Jovi will never be cool.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, people are eating this crap up.</p>\n<p>Let's ignore the absolute sexist bent of the comment for a second, if that's possible, and focus on the wealth of amazing music being made by young folks (I mean really young, the Tumblr generation of bands if you will) who have no regard for any of the &quot;rules&quot; that we have always played by, regardless of how punk we think we are.</p>\n<p>How To Dress Well, Odd Future, Janelle Monae, Grimes, and countless other young artists (you know, of the age that popular artists tend to be) are making music that seamlessly blends genres that we'd previously have considered verboten — imagine if <em>Paul's Boutique</em> was your <em>Abbey Road</em> — and they really don't care what some guitar teacher thinks.</p>\n",

As with musical tools, I tried to <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/2014/04/16/the-enemy-of-done/\">take my own advice</a> and pick one thing to stick to for a while, see how it goes. I happened to pick a less-popular, less-mature tool with less documentation and material out there than any other. But it's not based in Ruby, and that should make Alex happy.</p>\n<p>Jade was created by a 22-year-old CS undergraduate in England, and it's a super cool little pseudo-language for templates, written in Node. Unlike Ghost, which powers this blog, you don't need to get Node running on a web server to make sites with it, which can restrict your choice of web hosts. On the contrary, you run Node on your local box and generate a static site with the Jade processor, then host that bad boy pretty much anywhere.</p>\n<p>Here's a little bit about Jade, and if you've used templating engines before you may find it to be pretty familiar. If not, then it's a really good starter language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basic-syntax\" tabindex=\"-1\">Basic Syntax <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#basic-syntax\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If I had to pick a central principle of Jade's syntax, it'd be the indention-awareness. Yes, it's written in Javascript, but you won't see brackets and semicolons everywhere (which is something I think Sass has over LESS). Just indent the next line and you're nesting html or logic.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token tag\">body</span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token attr-class\">.container</span></span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\">h1<span class=\"token attr-class\">.pagetitle</span></span> <span class=\"token plain-text\">Page Title</span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\">p<span class=\"token attr-id\">#opening-paragraph</span></span> <span class=\"token plain-text\">This is some text.</span></code></pre>\n<p>Pretty simple, right? <code>div</code> is an implied tag, and the <code>#</code> and <code>.</code> do what you might expect if you passed CSS 101.

THe most basic is to put an <code>=</code> immediately (no spaces) after an element:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token tag\">h2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token code\"> dogname</span></code></pre>\n<p>This will produce <code>&lt;h2&gt;Rufus&lt;/h2&gt;</code>, which is a pretty great dog name you don't hear nearly often enough. But sometimes things aren't that simple, and you need to get the variable into a string. If you know you want to produce <code>&lt;a href=&quot;Rufus.html&quot;&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt;</code>, you can use a pound and curly bracket syntax.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token tag\">a<span class=\"token attributes\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token string\">\"#{dogname}\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>html</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token code\"> dogname</span></code></pre>\n<p>This combination of the two types of variable output gives us what we want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mixins-and-includes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mixins and Includes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#mixins-and-includes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Being tired of typing opening and closing carats is a pretty good reason to use Jade to begin with, but there's a lot more power in it than saved keystrokes and easy tag closing. Like CSS preprocessors, it gives you mixins, and like server-side languages, it provides for includes.</p>\n<p>Includes are so self-explanatory they're barely worth mentioning, but I'll say this: remember your indentation when you call the include. You want to make sure your HTML structure stays intact.</p>\n<p>Mixins are reusable blocks of markup or code that can take arguments. These can be used to absolutely destroy repetitive tasks. If you're in any way familiar with programming, think of a mixin as a function. Because that's what it is.</p>\n<p>The following</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token mixin\"><span class=\"token keyword\">mixin</span> <span class=\"token function\">gal_image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>imgurl<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>caption<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\">li</span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\">img<span class=\"token attributes\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token string\">\"images/#{imgurl}\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span></span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\">p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token code\"> caption</span></code></pre>\n<p>Looks a little tricky, but let's break it down.  First you define a mixin using the unsurprising keyword &quot;mixin.&quot; You can add arguments as well — and you will likely need to.</p>\n<p>You can output the arguments in both of the same ways you'd use explicitly defined variables. To use the mixin, just add a <code>+</code> and call it, putting the arguments in parentheses much like a javascript function. Here's an example usage for the above.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token mixin\"><span class=\"token name function\">+gal_image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"my_image.png\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token string\">\"This is an image\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>which produces</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>li</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>images/my_image.png<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>This is an image<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>li</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Not bad, right? As in this example, mixins can make short work of repetitive elements like photo gallery or portfolio images.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extends\" tabindex=\"-1\">Extends <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#extends\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As with many template languages like Smarty or Django, Jade utilizes the concept of child templates and <em>Extends</em> to make files more efficient and manageable. For instance, a website could have a <code>page</code> template and a <code>company-info</code> page template that's based on it. Extends can go as many levels deep as you like, but a typical case for a static site might be 3 levels: <em>base → page type → individual page.</em></p>\n<p>In order to take advantage of them, just add <code>extends</code> with the URL to the base template at the beginning of your file. If you want them to really work for you, you'll want to use <em>Blocks</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blocks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Blocks <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#blocks\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you've never used a templating system that features them, Blocks aren't immediately intuitive. But they're hugely powerful, and they're what makes Extends really work. In any given template, think of it this way: includes are static markup, but a block is something that could be variable from page to page.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token keyword\">include includes/header</span><br /><span class=\"token tag\">body</span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token attr-class\">.content</span></span><br />    <span class=\"token keyword\">block pagecontent</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">include includes/footer</span></code></pre>\n<p>Here, the header and footer are includes because they're the same throughout the site. But to get a variable piece of markup or content in the <code>.content</code> div, we use a Block.</p>\n<p>Now, on each page, tell Jade that we're extending the <code>base.jade</code> file, and reference the same <code>pagecontent</code> block:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-pug\"><code class=\"language-pug\"><span class=\"token keyword\">extends base</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">block pagecontent</span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\">h2</span> <span class=\"token plain-text\">My awesome title</span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\">p</span> <span class=\"token plain-text\">Hi I'm writing content! It's king, I hear.</span></code></pre>\n<p>Not rocket surgery. You can also define a default in the base template, so that in the event a given page doesn't have that block you can always fall back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-it-to-run\" tabindex=\"-1\">Getting it to Run <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/jade/#getting-it-to-run\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So how does this stuff work? I mentioned that it's not a back end language, so you're not going to run it on the server. It's pre-compiled into static files. Jade, like other Node-based tools, can be compiled in a number of ways. I'm not planning on getting too into that, but here are a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Node on the command line. This is the most basic. You can just compile a directory of Jade files into HTML, or have Node &quot;watch&quot; the directory and compile the files as you save them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a>, which can run lots of other Node-based things at the same time with a single command in the terminal, and then get packaged for a deployment environment that works the same as your development one. Unfortunately, Grunt requires a lot of up-front setup to make that single command work. There are resources out there.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://incident57.com/\">CodeKit for Mac</a> (this app is really what got me into Jade. It's a bit costly but fun and also works with plenty of other pre-compiling tools)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next I'll outline how I put together a portfolio site using Jade and LESS. Hopefully this was helpful.</p>\n",

No one, because you know the value of what you did. Because you did it for a reason. And what's more, when those visual cues, <a href=\"http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/topics/micro-interactions/\">microinteractions</a>, and precise responsive changes don't come out right, it not only makes for a substandard experience, it reflects poorly on <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>So... it's time to own it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-mythical-creatures-needed\" tabindex=\"-1\">No mythical creatures needed <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#no-mythical-creatures-needed\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is not more unicorn advocacy (fun fact: in the recruiting world, unicorns are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_squirrel\">&quot;purple squirrels&quot;</a>). The answer to all web software design problems is not &quot;turn all designers into expert coders.&quot; Not everyone wants to or is capable of doing it all. The chances of finding someone who does it all <em>really well</em> are not great. And when you do, over-taxing them with all the work is not going to scale very well. The solution is to empower the team for front-end development.</p>\n<p>Whether that means taking advantage of one of the unicorns you <em>do</em> have, or hiring a dedicated FED for your design team, it's crucial to build a bridge and stop treating design and FED as two different worlds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ok-not-different-worlds-then\" tabindex=\"-1\">OK, <em>not</em> different worlds then <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#ok-not-different-worlds-then\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>UX folks know that UX is tied to every discipline and role: Product, design, back end, IT, and even sales. But design teams are responsible for the UI portion, and nothing affects the UI in a web-based experience more than FED.</p>\n<p>So what does that actually mean, in a practical sense?</p>\n<p>A website or web based product is generally going to have a style guide, even if your shop is lost in the Stone Age. If you're rocking a more modern fashion, you may be using style tiles or a pattern library. But the key here is that your guide can't be a Photoshop file, a list of fonts, and a sprite sheet. It can't be a wiki with PNGs and descriptions. It certainly can't be a piece of paper. It has to live in its ultimate medium: the web. What is a CSS file, after all, but a style guide that actually <em>works</em>?</p>\n<p>Now, I recognize that every organization is different. With some exceptions, the dedicated FED teams I've worked with tend to be focused on the fun stuff that challenges them in the day to day: data bindings, animations, Gruntfiles (or is it Gulpfiles now?), and other fun scripting. They're worried not just about bridging the gap with you; in these Ajax-heavy times, they have to bridge the gap with the back end as well. And my guess is you're not dealing with strictly HTML/CSS folks — otherwise you wouldn't be having these problems.</p>\n<p>Still, it's not good form to run onto the field, jump on the mound, and snatch the glove from the current pitcher. Reach a hand over the wall instead of throwing your designs over it. If your team or theirs is unwilling or unable to put a FED on the design squad, it's your responsibility to make it work some other way. That way is going to mean finding the person most likely to feel some investment in the style control and working with them to build your pattern library or style guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-don-t-have-that-power\" tabindex=\"-1\">&quot;I don't have that power&quot; <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/strong-foundation/#i-don-t-have-that-power\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In all likelihood, you actually do.

      "title": "Harrison Mixbus first impressions",
      "content_html": "<p>I've never worked on an analog console. Sure, I've sat with someone and suggested technical and creative engineering decisions while they operated, but the UI paradigm of a console is only useful to me because I've used desktop mixers, and because pretty much all DAWs use some form of this paradigm. I don't have any allegiance to the old ways or the &quot;sound&quot; factor that usually consists of a bunch of vague assertions that analog summing is better (usually coupled with assertions that tape is better as well).</p>\n<p>But what I do have is that drive to find the better workflow, the fastest way to creativity mixed with the ability to generate results. I also can't pass by a deal. For a $20 &quot;no brainer&quot; deal, it was certainly worth trying out Harrison Mixbus, even though Pro Tools is the standard and is a generally satisfying experience once you learn it.</p>\n<p>The origins of Mixbus are interesting enough on their own: the project was born from an open source Linux DAW called <a href=\"https://ardour.org/\">Ardour</a>. The Harrison console company, known for their super high end consoles used on a huge amount of popular records, used the existing open codebase as a skeleton that they fleshed out with their own EQ, compression/leveling, saturation, and summing algorithms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"out-of-the-box\" tabindex=\"-1\">Out of the box <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#out-of-the-box\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Installing is a minor pain due to the requirement of a JACK installation, and subsequent restart. JACK is a system-level audio router that's somewhere between Soundflower and Propellerheads' ReWire. Apparently Ardour needs it to route from an audio interface to its own tracks. This means the JACK server, really a separate piece of software, has to run at the same time as Mixbus, but a side benefit is that audio can pretty easily be routed into it from other applications.</p>\n<p>Why's that important? Well, to me it's important because Ableton handles all of my composition work, and Ableton is not that great at mixing compared with a package like Pro Tools. Unfortunately, ReWire mode in Ableton disables all the VST/AU plugins, rendering a good chunk of my instruments unusable. So I usually end up rendering audio tracks from Ableton and mixing those in PT, which is not necessarily going to get me the best results, aside from being a crappier workflow. I haven't yet gotten Mixbus controlling the transport in Ableton, but it does seem possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ui\" tabindex=\"-1\">UI <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#ui\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Ardour was built originally for Linux. Thankfully, the Mac OS version does not require X11 or a Java VM. It hardly appears &quot;native,&quot; though. The reverse-color scheme, the Gnome-style file pickers and very Linux-y UI components are alien, distracting, and not very impressive. Keyboard shortcuts aren't intuitive either: some are borrowed from Pro Tools and that helps, but system-wide commands like Command-backtick for window switching, or even Command-W and Command-H, are nowhere to be found. Many of the commands use Option as their modifier key, which is awkward. Still, a lot of the editing functions are single-key, something that absolutely has to be the case before a DAW can even sit in the same room with Pro Tools. I suppose I could probably re-map them to their PT equivalents, too.</p>\n<p>By far the thing you'll notice about the UI the most is the mixer. I've written about <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mikepropst/grabbin-knobs-764a4c79e503\">skeuomorphs in audio software</a> before, and it's all the same here. Harrison love to tout that they're a console maker, not a software maker, but that works both ways, and their application of a heavy, quasi-realistic mixer design has me gazing longingly at the screenshots of Ardour's relatively clean and straightforward (almost Ableton-esque) mixer. But as they'll tell you, this is a thing meant to replace an analog mixer, and the affordances (in the <a href=\"http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html\">Norman sense</a>) offered by the skeuomorphs help the special features come forward. In a way, it seems like they're intentionally reaching backward, and you can feel it when you mix.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fast-access\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fast Access <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#fast-access\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>First off, there's the impressive list of built-in elements on every channel strip, and I admit this is something that I'd probably miss if I were coming from the console world. I'm already enjoying them. In a typical DAW, pretty much everything, with the exception of EQ in some cases, is a plugin.</p>\n<p>But in Mixbus, we get a lot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Input gain independent of the fader or the clip gain.</li>\n<li>a 3-band parametric EQ plus high-pass filter.</li>\n<li>A compressor with three ratio types, speed control, and makeup gain. The threshold control and gain reduction meter sit right next to the fader and level meter.</li>\n<li>A number of parameters from the selected insert plugin on the channel.</li>\n<li>On the 4 mix busses and one master bus, there are tape saturators and different compressors tuned for the purpose.</li>\n<li>On the master bus, a phase alignment meter and &quot;K-meter&quot; to measure perceived loudness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What all of this accomplishes is a mix process that involves far less instantiation of plugins, far less opening of separate windows, and a workflow that keeps you looking at the mixer and maintaining a holistic picture of the mix most of the time. This is of course Harrison's goal, and I think they've met it well.</p>\n<p>The major downside to this mixer is that there are only 4 &quot;mix busses.&quot; You can add any number of busses for reverbs and other effects, but only the mix busses have delay compensation. That means a lot of multiple-bus tricks that analog and PT users employ, such as parallel compression, are out of the picture due to the phasing that'll happen without delay compensation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-how-does-it-sound\" tabindex=\"-1\">But how does it sound <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#but-how-does-it-sound\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Again, I admit to knowing little about the console world. I've never wired one, and my understanding of routing and bussing comes largely from years of Pro Tools. Mixbus mirrors the real thing even more closely than PT, which provides both benefits and limitations (as with the limited mix busses). So what does it do for the sound?</p>\n<p>I have to say, I've been impressed so far. But I'm not quite sure if it's the much-touted Harrison summing engine or whether the availability of the tools has let me get a good mix faster. Having EQs out front is important because you're tempted to use them. And most tracks are really going to need at least a little, but that tiny thought that pops up when you add a plugin creates enough of a barrier that you might skip it. And when you do add a plugin, it's probably going to have quite a few bands, and a distracting graphical display that makes you think you're doing something right because the curve &quot;looks good&quot; even though you might need more or less on a given band. Mixbus's basic EQ has two shelves and a bandpass that work in limited ranges, a Q that varies based on the amount of boost/cut, and a high-pass. Simple. No controllable Q, no ability to put all 3 bands in the high frequencies and create an insanely hyper-tweaked situation. Of course you can still do all that with the same plugins you know and love now, but you can get a really good mix just by carving each channel as necessary and then applying little touches of the onboard compression.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\" tabindex=\"-1\">Performance <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#performance\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are some problems on the performance front. I was able to do some very quick mixes efficiently that sounded great without a lot of hassle, but with tunes that had about 6 tracks and not a lot of plugins (thankfully, you don't need as many plugins with Harrison). But when a client delivered me some songs with 27+ tracks to mix, it died pretty quickly. The meters don't respond, moving knobs and faders ceases to really do anything — the latency all around just gets ridiculous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"side-by-side\" tabindex=\"-1\">Side by Side? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/harrison-mixbus/#side-by-side\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, Pro Tools still has a lot going for it. I find myself doing a lot of wild and (IMO) creative stuff in PT when it comes to routing and bussing, stuff you just wouldn't be able to do with an analog console — or a DAW that mirrors one too closely.</p>\n<p>And though I don't do a <em>lot</em> of MIDI work inside PT, I definitely have done some, and it's good to know it's there. I can add a nice synth to a track without going crazy routing multiple programs.</p>\n<p>Mixbus also has some good editing tools, some of which are minor UI innovations and others of which are cribbed from PT, but PT is a much faster and more powerful editing machine. It's also one that I know already whereas I've played with Mixbus for about 3 days. I've no doubt I could get pretty handy with the flexible editing functions in Mixbus as well.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it's a great mixer, competent editor, and it sounds very good with no supplemental software. If you're looking to make great sounding tracks for a lot cheaper than Pro Tools and don't need MIDI functionality beyond sync, it's a really compelling tool.</p>\n<p>And it's <em>fun</em>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtL1SAmjANxmLD_mILAx3Zg\">Harrison's YouTube channel</a> is an easy way to get started playing with real practical functionality within a few minutes. The videos are short and informative, and even have some helpful general mix tips.)</p>\n",

He's perfected a fairly interesting technique of processing sound sources with some rhythm into multiple tracks of kick-snares, bass, and clattering beat-repeaters.</p>\n<p>Recently he started selling his secret sauce in the form of some impulse responses for convolution reverbs as well as a $10 instructional video, <em>Rhythmic Processing</em>.</p>\n<p>I thought I'd try it out.</p>\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/siAfTrUsCJ4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The basic premise of this short (under 10 minutes) video is that Stocco plays a rhythm with a chopstick on an acoustic guitar, then walks you through his Ableton Live effects chains to show how he turns the whole thing into a massive beat with tons of variations and atmospheric textures.</p>\n<p>The first thing you'll notice is that he's efficient — this thing requires a lot of pausing to look at the settings of the plugins. That's fine, I'm sick of overly long YouTube tutorials.</p>\n<p>His method is basically to take the sound and split it, using EQs and filters, into multiple bands on multiple return channels in Ableton. This is a technique I've used in Pro Tools for complex &quot;fixing&quot; on already-mixed sources (I don't have any dedicated multiband processors), but as a creative exercise it's pretty neat.</p>\n<p>Stocco doesn't prescribe any particular plugins. However, non-advanced Ableton users may balk at the fact that a couple of the plugs he relies very heavily upon cost money.</p>\n<p>There are, however, free sequenced gates out there for VST and AU, as well as a few &quot;trance gates&quot; on the <a href=\"http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library/\">NI User Library</a> if you're into Reaktor. For the ultimate no-cost sequenced gate, just place a standard Ableton gate effect in place of Stocco's plugin and feed a sequenced percussive sound into the side chain. Not tough.</p>\n<p>Is it worth $10? Well, it's nothing that someone else might not be able to show you, but Stocco is known for this stuff and it's worth a glimpse under the hood. The video is very short, and that may put some people off, but it's very dense in information. I felt pretty inspired.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I'm sure that you've heard, at some point, some wizened sage say a thing about how limitations are helpful when it comes to creative endeavors.</p>\n<p>Probably it was someone like Frank Zappa who didn't practice what they preached, but this isn't just &quot;good for you&quot; advice; it can be fun.</p>\n<p>What simplification means in a creative sense can be up to you: it could mean limited tools, a smaller palette, a shortened time frame, or really impractical and artificial constraints meant to &quot;get the juices flowing&quot; (e.g., I'm only going to use MS Paint or build a song with presets from early 90s synths). But as an exercise, it's one thing; adopting simplicity as a <em>way of working</em> is a freeing experience.</p>\n<p>After a some great frustration playing in a large band with intricate arrangments, I decided to simplify my musical existence by going back to a one-man show for a while. But that tends to be a rabbit hole for me. I love choices and hate limitations. I don't necessarily feel like I need to use my whole toolkit in every project, but I want to know I can start anywhere. The problem often <em>is</em> in starting, though. A limited palette can make that easy.</p>\n<p>So I've created a much smaller subset of tools: two sampled analog drum kits, a <a href=\"http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_keys/\">Volca Keys</a>, a '73 <a href=\"http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/sh1000.php\">Roland SH-1000</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library/entry/show/7777/\">Reaktor-based Minimoog emulator</a>, and a <a href=\"http://meeblip.com/\">MeeBlip SE</a>. It's a kind of weird hybrid of real and simulated analog, and it's all <em>really cheap</em>. It also feels like a pretty wide sonic palette right off the bat, but I do need <em>some</em> kind of variety because I tend to write synth lines based on the qualities of a particular sound. The Minimoog has enough variety to spark something unique, but picking from two drum kits means I'm laying down a beat in 5 minutes instead of auditioning sounds and building kits for 40.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend I wrote a complete song during the baby's nap time. A couple hours and everything was done. Beat, bass, lead line, effects, tricks, vocals. Done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-nice-side-effect\" tabindex=\"-1\">A nice side effect <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/enemy-of-done/#a-nice-side-effect\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Something that I discovered from going limited is that simplicity isn't the only benefit — the <em>inability to achieve perfection</em> has opened my mind quite a bit. I've kept the SH-1000 out of my sets for anything other than some noisy filter effects because it's monophonic, hard to play, hard to keep in tune, and doesn't have MIDI or the ability to save sounds. With Ableton, I don't need MIDI or patches: as long as I can adequately play a loop one or two times through, I have a bass or lead line recorded as audio. The key here is <em>adequate</em>. It's not going to be perfectly synced, and even if I played it perfectly it wouldn't necessarily register with the 40-year-old raggedy-ass keys and the tuning would still be wonky. The Volca's similar: it can be synced to MIDI, but it can't save sounds either and the tuning tends toward unpredictability.</p>\n<p>So this stuff means my music isn't perfect. But it's also got some character as a result. Aside from how you feel about tweaking sounds or cutting loops precisely, whether these things improve your music, there's one thing you can't argue with: I finished something. Quite a few somethings.</p>\n<p>There's a saying that &quot;good is the enemy of great.&quot; That's true, and you should always keep your standards high and your goals lofty — but remember also that <strong>perfect</strong> is the enemy of <strong>done</strong>.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I often wonder what the intersection of my two primary interests — UX and music — might be. Unfortunately, it usually seems like the main manifestation of this is in the obsessive tweaking of processes and tools.</p>\n<p>It's probably natural for UX designers of a certain experience level to engage in <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/tweakin/uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/03/why-ux-professionals-should-care-about-service-design.php\">service design</a> thinking. You eventually start to think about the holistic world rather than just the point where a customer touches a software interface. But then again, it could very well be that the obsessive desire to have the perfect experience yourself is the driver of that kind of thinking. It's a chicken and egg situation, but whichever came first with me, my point is this: I'm constantly editing my tool chain.</p>\n<p>The answer may very well be in simplicity (more on that at another time), and it definitely lies in <em>compromise.</em> I'm just not sure there's a really perfect process. Transparent tools that don't make you think are pretty much the ideal for creatives — for instance, in a live situation, tools that keep you from touching the laptop trackpad. That's why I bought an Akai APC40 controller for Ableton on Craigslist, but of course I still have to open new files, and that's a source of inaccuracy and anxiety onstage. So I've been trying to crack that nut. The quest continues. And in the meantime, I use the hardware equivalent of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill\">polyfill</a>, something that a layman might call &quot;a trackball on stage.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Same in the studio.</strong> My best purchase of the past year was not a plugin or piece of hardware but a set of $10 keyboard shortcut stickers for Pro Tools. It eased my learning and enabled me to work much faster, especially in the editing stage of a mix. The up-front setup (about an hour peeling and sticking these little nightmare labels), analogous to say, setting up a new project management software, made every subsequent day a little easier. Until I ruined the keyboard with a beer spill. Don't drink and mix, kids.</p>\n<p><strong>Same with design.</strong> I've been playing with <a href=\"http://mikepropst.com/blog/tweakin/www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/\">Sketch</a> and ended up buying it because of the insane speed it offered me in a few key areas after just a short learning curve. The paradigm shift is just different enough that it mirrors Ableton: a program that is indeed a DAW and has mixer sliders but requires a completely different thought process from the old-school Pro Tools/Cubase mentality. Sketch is definitely a design tool, but it's been honed and trimmed back to incorporate only the elements you need for the particular type of design you're doing; in this case, it's screen design. But... there are holes. It doesn't do bitmaps at all, I mean <em>at all</em>, even compared to Illustrator. so I lose the valuable hybrid &quot;don't think about the vector/bitmap divide&quot; approach of the otherwise-clunky Fireworks. Which means that again, my process is incomplete and I have to fill in the gaps with workarounds and additional tools.</p>\n<p>So what's the answer? I don't think there is one. If I rewrote this post next year, I'd be talking about different tools but it'd look remarkably similar. At some point you have to settle for &quot;good enough it's not in my way,&quot; but it's still worths striving for the zen happy place of &quot;perfection.&quot;</p>\n",

It's probably one of my nerdiest hobbies -- I can't really come down on anyone who memorizes worthless sports stats because I know which Current 93 record Steve Ignorant of Crass sings on and the years each of Neil Diamond's <em>Hot August Night</em> live albums were released.</p>\n<p>This was a lot harder before the internet; most information came in the form of serendipity when a recognized name cropped up in liner notes.</p>\n<p>Since the advent of the web and standardized sources of info, it's easy to trace origins. But sometimes because there aren't any liner notes anymore (if you're buying mp3s or streaming), little tidbits and cover songs can slip through.</p>\n<p>That's the case with The Equals: I hadn't heard of them but when I heard a loud <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhKd1Vzr-YQ\">glam-rock stomper</a> by them on KOOP, I looked into it. Not only was the singer Eddy Grant the guy who lodged &quot;Electric Avenue&quot; in our collective brains, they had a pretty solid influence on the Clash. Here's the original version of another ahead-of-its-time song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hHUdW1N3v8\">the Clash did a great job with</a>, &quot;Police on My Back.&quot;</p>\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/DH0Guwo_ky0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I guess as long as there's music out there, it's possible to be surprised every once in a while still.
