            <p>Eric Meyer on the CSS Working Group's attempts to add conditionals to CSS. My most recent side project uses pure CSS with variables, which is a huge step toward me not caring about preprocessors anymore. With logic, the only things left are concatenation (probably solved already), and nesting syntax, which I find cleaner to go through later on. He's right though, as a Sass user I can easily see both sides of this argument and don't know what's right. But I know it's progress, and in my current way of thinking, more features in CSS is better. Because no matter how "bloated" you think it'll be, it's still better than having to use extra tools that aren't natively parsed by the web browser.</p>

          <p>Framer Sites looks wild. Framer already generates pretty good HTML, and this seems to represent the final few pieces necessary to actually turn that into a functional website. And CMS features are coming soon? Finally someone's really coming for the king in a big way, for the first time since the king has been Figma.</p>
          <p>Is this finally The Thing we've been looking for? A design tool that builds websites visually, but in a real "web-like" way? That's been an unsatisfactory process since my first job using NetObjects Fusion (which apparently is better in itself these days, using CSS grid instead of the absolute positioning it employed almost 25 years ago). Frankly, potentially exciting, although these days — as in those days — it's fun to whip up some HTML to create a nice looking site. Still feels like alchemy to me. </p>
