[Framer Sites](https://www.framer.com/sites/) looks wild. Framer already generates pretty good HTML, and this seems to represent the final few pieces necessary to actually turn that into a functional website. And CMS features are coming soon? Finally someone's really coming for the king in a big way, for the first time since the king has been Figma.

Is this finally The Thing we've been looking for? A design tool that builds websites visually, but in a real "web-like" way? That's been an unsatisfactory process since my first job using NetObjects Fusion (which apparently is better in itself these days, using CSS grid instead of the absolute positioning it employed almost 25 years ago). Frankly, potentially exciting, although these days — as in those days — it's fun to whip up some HTML to create a nice looking site. Still feels like alchemy to me.
