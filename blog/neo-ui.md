From a 21-year-old design student at Potsdam. It's not 100% practical. But the idea that revolution (or even *evolution*) in [desktop operating system UIs](https://www.desktopneo.com/) is going to come not from Apple or Microsoft but from a kid who's been natively dealing with multi-touch screens since they were old enough to drive a car is plausible. The idea that folders are on the way out is already obvious, too.
