Yes, Lite XL happened this year and it's been great on Linux but is a little janky on Mac. So I've stuck with what I know, which is the electron-based Atom by Github. Imagine my surprise when I went to make a couple CSS tweaks to this site today and found that Atom will be sunset... tomorrow.

So here I am with VSCodium, the MS-telemetry-free version of their VS Code. I'd like to take the opportunity to try something that isn't electron (even though a text editor for web projects might be the most logical use of the technology), but I need to get some requisite Python tools to make CudaText work and the list is actually pretty short these days. Seems that if you have the money for Sublime you're using it, and if you don't you're on VS Code. Oh well.
