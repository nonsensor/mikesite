I always do this, but honestly it was not a huge year for me in terms of listening to new music. I'm still jamming Necrot's *Mortal* (2020) on the regular and couldn't tell you much about what new death metal is out there. And two of my favorite bands were cut down by tragedy: Low due to Mimi Parker's untimely death from cancer, and Neurosis from the revelation that Scott Kelly was an abusive sociopath. 

- Sky Pig - *It Thrives In Darkness*
- Petbrick - *Liminal*
- Blut Aus Nord - *Disharmonium - Undreamable Abysses*
- Lykotonon - *Promethean Pathology*
- Hissing - *Hypervirulence Architecture*
- ADULT. - *Becoming Undone*
- Nik Colk Void - *Bucked up Space*
- Wet Leg - *Wet Leg* (I'm still hip!)
- J처hann J처hannsson - *Drone Mass* (this is mostly here because it exists. It's a gift to have more J처hann after his death)
- Locrian - *New Catastrophism*
- Vermin Womb - *Retaliation*
- Primitive Man - *Insurmountable*
- Undeath - *It's Time... To Rise From The Grave*
- H채llas - *Isle of WIsdom*
- KEN Mode - *NULL*
- Conjurer - *Pathos*
- Crowbar - *Zero and Below* (It's Crowbar... come on)
- Orthodox - *Proceed*
- Vanum - *Legend*

That was in no particular order, but I think the top spot is occupied by Haunted Horses' *The Worst Has Finally Happened*. Monstrous and unique. It does the things I like. Check it out.
