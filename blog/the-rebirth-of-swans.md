In 2007, I had seen pretty much every Angels of Light or Michael Gira solo tour that had happened since the breakup of Swans. I was pretty burnt my missing the final Swans Are Dead tour so I took every opportunity. Then Gira released a new Angels album with [Akron/Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron/Family) as the backing band. It's all fairly repetitive and hypnotic compared to earlier Angels of Light records, but "Black River Song" in particular kind of exploded my mind when I heard it. Combined with the cover art by Deryk Thomas, who also painted *Love of Life* and *White Light From The Mouth of Infinity* covers, it all added up to Swans. I couldn't stop listening to the tune, and probably telling everyone I knew that this meant Swans were coming back.

At the advent of the Swans reboot, Michael Gira repeatedly told a wonderful yarn. Seth of Akron/Family hit a huge chord on stage and it made Gira realize that he wanted more Swans. But when I listen to this tune, I still feel like it was there, dying to get out. And given that he's done what might be his best stuff since the reboot, I'm pretty glad it was.
