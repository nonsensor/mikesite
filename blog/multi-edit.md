I think it's probably safe to say that Figma eroded their own trust with the whole Adobe deal, which was [preemptively killed by EU regulators](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/). It definitely made Dylan Field look like just another startup founder looking for a payday by selling to a big company. Unfortunately for him, his company made something too indispensible to merge. 

To their credit, they have since continued to move forward with new features, some of which are pretty useful and some of which are the now depressingly-standard "look, we added AI to a thing."

The newest one is way beyond "pretty useful." [Multi edit](https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-multiple-lives-of-multi-edit/) is so rad. Legitimate game-changer that makes long-standing problems like "when do I stop designing intuitively and start turning these pieces into components?" just vanish. Check out the playground file if you can't get your head around why this is so valuable.
