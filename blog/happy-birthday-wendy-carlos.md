Wendy Carlos created soundtracks for *Tron*, *A Clockwork Orange*, and many more. She introduced millions to the potential of the synthesizer as a "real" instrument via *Switched On Bach.* And she even worked with Robert Moog on the development of his legendary synthesizer.

Here she is in a fascinating interview on *NOVA* in 1989 — height of the DX7's reign, but she explains subtractive synthesis on the classic Moog Modular as well as some amazing additive synthesis on a computer.
