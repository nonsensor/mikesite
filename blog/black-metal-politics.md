This is great. Fast Co gets metal logo designer Christophe Szpajdel to [redesign the logos](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3047747/2016s-presidential-hopefuls-rebranded-as-black-metal-bands#1) of all the bazillion players in the 2016 campaign.

The other interesting thing about this is that one guy designed all those unreadable black metal logos, from Gorgoroth and Emperor to Wolves in the Throne Room.
