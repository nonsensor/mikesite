I had forgotten about [the DAK catalog](https://cabel.com/2023/11/06/dak-and-the-golden-age-of-gadget-catalogs/), but I used to love it. If you had met me only in the past couple years, you'd think I was some kind of tech-hater, knowledgeable but only using it when necessary. But I think it's people like me who were so enamored with gadgets and the possibilities of tech who hate it even more these days. Everything seemed so wild and *possible.*
