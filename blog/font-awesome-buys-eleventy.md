I don't really even know [what this means](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-font-awesome/). Font Awesome does seem to be a pretty swell company as these things go, but even if they screw up monumentally, Eleventy being open source means that someone can easily fork the last version that we liked. I will probably continue using Eleventy for the foreseeable future because I like it.

## Plus, comments
In other news, I added some comments to the blog. I don't know who reads it anymore, but it feels a bit out of touch with anyone who might because it just kind of lives out here on its own. I'm trying out a system called [Chirpy](https://chirpy.dev/), which is hosted but the code is open source and it doesn't have all the really sus junk that comes with Disqus.
