This one is tough. Mark Hollis recently passed, and that was difficult to process but in the musical sense he was already gone, having left a near-perfect legacy of forward-thinking avant-pop that to most people's minds invented post-rock.

Scott Walker on the other hand, despite his age, was still fairly prolific, especially considering his attention to craft and detail.

I can think of at least 4 moments where he defied expectations: Quitting teen idoldom to write music, *Scott 4*, his songs on *Nite Flights*, and *Climate of Hunter*, which really established the rest of his career. There was nothing else on earth like them. There was nobody on earth like *him*. And there never will be.
