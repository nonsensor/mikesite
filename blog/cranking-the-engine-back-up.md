I think I'm going to maybe do some blogging again? I've always had trouble with writing in the blog because I feel like it should be about UX. I generally want to write about synths and studio stuff. It is what it is. I'm now officially Too Old to be concerned whether potential employers look at my portfolio, see my blog, and realize that I don't spend every waking hour thinking about designing software. Also, I'm not really looking.
