Promised for a while, finally [Zed](https://zed.dev) arrives. It's written by some of the creators of Atom, but instead of another Electron thing it's a very fast-performing app written in Rust.

It's multiplayer, apparently, which as someone who was once subjected to pair programming I've always found that a little weird. But it works for Figma, right?

Anyway, I wrote this post in it. Will be nice to see it appear on Linux, a platform that is surprisingly lacking in lightweight code editors. Between the anemic GEdit and a full blown IDE you have [Lite XL](/blog/lite-xl/), Microsoft's Electron-based VSCode, and of course the influential but non-free Sublime, which has persisted. I don't love any of them, but I'm liking this so far.
