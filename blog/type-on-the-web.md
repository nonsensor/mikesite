Some great fundamentals [here](https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/). Other than the wide trend toward cranking the size that's been going on for a few years, really solid type work on the web is only recently coming into its own. It's kind of like when Khoi Vinh popularized grids a few years back; it made me wonder how many folks in this business have even studied design. I think it's great when people with more formal knowledge spread it to the web. 

When it comes to type though, it's only been recently that we've been able to have a real level of control over it.
