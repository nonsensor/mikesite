Luke Wroblewski [on login screens](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1941):

> Quite quickly I came to see password-masking as a rut. A design pattern that has been around so long that no one thinks about it much. We all just go through the motions when assembling a log-in screen and add password-masking by default. Lost business and usability issues just come along for the ride.

Really makes u think.

(Not long before this, my team and I got in a fight about this topic, and we won. Pretty cool!)
