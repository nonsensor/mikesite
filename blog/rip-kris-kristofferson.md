My mom loved to say she hated **Kris Kristofferson**. We used to go back and forth over that. She'd say he couldn't sing, I'd say it didn't matter because he was more of a writer. He was respected by the greats, not just the singers who sang his songs, but to other renowned writers like Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. He couldn't really act either, though he probably [edged out Willie in that regard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KulkHZIEuIc).

What a lot of folks are remembering him for right now though, since **Sinead O'Connor**'s death is still fairly fresh, is his [defending her when nobody else would](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/arts/music/kris-kristofferson-sinead-oconnor.html). Maybe it's problematic to remember such a fierce feminist with an event like th is ("I didn't need a man to rescue me," she later said, though she was indeed shaken). But it's a great way to remember a good ol' boy who — like Willie — often defied stereotypes.
