[Don't name your band after the villains](http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1110-why-viet-cong-have-changed-their-name-an-interview-with-frontman-matt-flegel/) if you don't have any idea what you're talking about. Further... if someone calls you on it, at least pretend you did know what you were doing at the time, otherwise you're just a tool. It's almost like #145, "Don't pretend you don't understand why your use of Nazi imagery bothers everyone." (Hi Iceage).
