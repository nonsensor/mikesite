Have you considered increasing your attention span by reading a real book? I'm trying! I swear it kinda helps. I've actually been diving into the classics a bit more. I've also been carrying my books with me all over thanks to the Boox Palma tablet, a really magical device that I bought specifically for this purpose. I know they have a color one now, but I'm really into the fact that this little guy is mostly only good for one thing.

### Great Expectations (Dickens)
I like Dickens because I'm a dirty pinko, right? But this one took me by surprise a little. For half the book, it's mostly a collection of character portraits, and much of it's very funny. When the "twist" (that I assume he expected you to see coming) arrives, it darkens significantly and becomes... dare I say, more Dickensian? Loved it.

### Frankenstein (Mary Shelly)
I tried this a long time ago and it was tough. *Frankenstein* is an old book, and it shows. The language is sometimes slow to get through, though never actually really difficult. But it has one of my favorite literary elements, the unreliable narrator. Unlike, say, *Lolita*'s Humbert Humbert who is deliberately deceiving the reader, Frankenstein is comsumed by self-pity and can't think of anything else other than "poor VIctor." But the final monologue of the Creature really seals the deal that this isn't a simple story with a villain and a victim. It is, however, extremely melodramatic and gothic in pretty much every sense of the word. Suppose it's now time to watch Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation.

### The Bell Jar (Sylvia Plath)
Socialists and other radicals sometimes try to make the case that the modern epidemics of mental illness, especially depression, are not so much chemically caused as societally induced. Indeed, we're so [out of balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi) that our attempts to shoehorn ourselves into the brutal realities of corporate-dominated techno-dystopia have worn us down. Plath's story makes a decent case for this kind of reasoning, because almost all of the factors that seem to contribute to her emotional and mental breakdown are related to being a woman in the 1950s -- a situation that I can more than understand breaking someone's brain. But her language is by far my favorite kind: simple, yet incredibly evocative. It feels to me like that's probably the hardest way to write. I know that's supposedly what Hemingway did, but his economy to me was just dry and doesn't conjure pictures. Plath is so good at it that I really wish she had written more novels.

### The Hollow Places (T. Kingfisher)
Gotta do some genre fiction in there as well. This book features a creative premise  that's almost capital-w Weird, but it's rarely actually scary. Which is frustrating, because it could've been. I think the author is someone worth trying again though.

### The Occult Roots of Nazism (Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke)
Much has been written about the connection the Nazis, especially Himmler, had to the dark arts. The whole Indiana Jones franchise was based on it. But there isn't a lot out there that's accurate and not salacious. This book, from 1985, traces a line from volkisch philosophy in the 1800s through the Theosophists and all the way to Sebottendorf's Thule Society and the creation of the SS. And Goodrick-Clarke does it in the absolute driest way possible, so you can't help but think it's well-researched and accurate. Apparently historians generally agree. Unfortunately, it's not going to make *Raiders of the Lost Ark* look like nonfiction, but unlike a lot of books on the causes and influences of the Third Reich, it paints a balanced picture that isn't so tabloidy and doesn't claim the over-importance of this particular influence. It does present more evidence of the weird connection that often arises between occult/magical practice and right-wing extremism (something he focused on more broadly in another book that I'll just have to read now).
