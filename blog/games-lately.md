Here's what I've been mashing my thumbs to for the past few months.   
## Astro Bot   
It's fun. Lots of great little details and a wealth of new mechanics that come and go only once. I can't help but think all the editors of PlayStation-centric sites that called this "game of the year" do not own Nintendos and have never played *Mario Odyssey*. Still, it's nice to see something like this on PS5. They can't all be grit and despair.   
## Silent Hill 2 Remake   
Speaking of. So much has been said about this game. Pick a dozen other famous titles of and the writing on them combined wouldn't equal the ink given to *Silent Hill 2*. I read [a whole damn book](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/silent-hill-2-by-mike-drucker) about it. So there's not much that I can add. It's just a great synthesis of storytelling and gameplay throughout, and it's an achievement for so many reasons. It's stressful, it's depressing, the protagonist is not at all likable, combat is terrible — and all of these are intentional. David Lynch, Francis Bacon, *Crime and Punishment *are not the ingredients of a typical game, but that's why it's stood up for so long.   
## Layers of Fear   
This is a short walking simulator in the vein of *Gone Home* or *What Remains of Edith Finch*, and it's a sad mystery like those, but it's creepy and loaded with jump scares. Was it Bloober Team's audition to be the *Silent Hill 2* remake studio? I don't know, but there is a huge amount of influence from SH, just as Bloober went on to add their own stamp to the remake. Worth a few bucks and a few hours for sure.   
## Control   
Man this game was a blast. It oozes style. The "mid-century modern but just a little off" aesthetic of the sets reminded me of the *Legion* TV show, and the story is surreal, scary, and funny. It's getting on in age but I am still hesitant to talk about my favorite moments for fear of spoiling anyone who hasn't played it. *Control*'s creators describe it as "weird fiction" but in video game form, and I think that's apt. There are shades of Lovecraft, Cronenberg, Lynch, China Mieville, Jason Pargin, and the SCP Project — but none of those have cool psychic combat.   
## Alan Wake   
I got the much-loved sequel super cheap and it's related to *Control*, so it seemed like a thing I needed to do. But it didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, as a protagonist Alan Wake isn't much more likable than James Sunderland, but at least in *Silent Hill* punishing James was the *point*.   
## Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate   
We consume a lot of Ninja Turtle stuff around here. My daughter is obsessed. We've seen the full run of the 2012 series, *Rise of the TMNT*, plus *Mutant Mayhem* numerous times and a good chunk of the original series. Of course, she must never know that there was a live action movie in the early 90s.

*Splintered Fate* is basically *Hades* but with TMNT instead of Greek gods. If you understand that and it sounds good to you, play it.
