I've been moving a lot of posts finally from the old Kirby system. It just involves sucking metadata out of the Kirby format and into the frontmatter that Eleventy uses, which is something more portable for the next inevitable move.

But while the process is more manual than I would like, it has given me an opportunity to look at old content. There are some really interesting links I've blogged. Unfortunately, a HUGE chunk of them do not work anymore.

It's hard not to see this as something fundamentally messed up. Like, we've broken the internet somehow.
