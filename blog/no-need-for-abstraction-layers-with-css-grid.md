Rachel Andrew, the Guru of Grids, on [why you don't need a "Grid Framework" to use CSS Grid](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/01/you-do-not-need-a-css-grid-based-grid-system/). For me, part of the desire to use grid is right here â€” the additional overhead of throwing in a grid system is just unnecessary. And with Grid comes horizontal and vertical alignment, markup without containers, and so many more possibilities for layout.

Even fallbacks, one reason frameworks tend to get popular, aren't needed in her estimation:

> Create solid markup, uncluttered by additional elements that the past tells you that you need. Design your site using what Grid and other new methods have to offer. Then look at how you deal with the browsers without support, by serving them something slightly simpler.

Now that Edge fully supports Grid, it's probably time to stop farting around and really learn it, now that I've finally embraced flexbox.
