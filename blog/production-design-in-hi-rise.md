[This looks very cool](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2016/march/inside-high-rise/). I tend to get pretty excited about JG Ballard movies in general — they turn out better than most Philip K Dick adaptations — and *High-Rise* looks pretty promising. These designs look authentically of a particular time, but their generic nature reminds me of the products in *Repo Man*.
