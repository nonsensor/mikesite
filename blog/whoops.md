When moving site hosts to save a buck I seem to have screwed some things up. I'm not interested in paying for a new Kirby license so I'm trying a static site generator ([Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)). Unfortunately, as much as I was able to do some bulk text conversion, I'm just not an expert at that stuff. For everything I love about Kirby, it unfortunately does not store all the page data in frontmatter like almost every other CMS or site generator. So it's been a bit of a pain.

The upshot: even compared to Kirby or Grav or whatever, this thing should be *fast.*

TODO:
- Relocate older posts
- Recreate the old listing page (maybe?)
- ~~Get rid of "/blog/" as the first link in the listing~~
