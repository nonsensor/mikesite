[This is pretty awesome](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_pirate_bay_to_authorities_f-u.php), regardless of your opinion of TPB. If you see them as sort of punk rock establishment fighters, you're bound to love the visual middle finger. If you think they're villains, well at least they're suitably entertaining ones.
