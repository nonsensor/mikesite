Love the [contradictory name](https://lite-xl.com/). I don't necessarily want to get on the Electron hate train, but when you see the speed at which this thing fires up (much faster than VSCode, faster than GEdit, even) you might consider ditching Atom. It strikes a nice balance of features and performance.
