If you've ever worked with me, you know that playing with small to medium content management systems is a hobby of mine. Last year I settled on Kirby as my system of choice for running my own website. However, I was keeping my blog on a Digital Ocean droplet running Node and Ghost.

Ghost is definitely a more modern, slick system that I've been really pleased with. But I did want to consolidate things into a single site. So my new blog and RSS feed are operated on the same Kirby system as the rest of my site. If nothing else, I didn't have to learn anything about the server, the templating tools, or anything else in order to get it redesigned and fit in. Flexibility was important — now I can have my own fields and post types pretty easily.

And since both systems are reliant on Markdown for content and Ghost has a handy simple JSON export, porting was not a big deal. Let me know if you see any issues.
