On the way to work this morning, I heard Op Ivy's "Bad Town," and I realized two things:

1. It is objectively the worst song on *Energy*.
2. Tim Armstrong's obsession with both rap and violence, which came to a head with his and Travis Barker's awful group the Transplants, is nothing new.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/j6EVwQJN3oA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><br></div>

Not going anywhere with that. Just thinking.
