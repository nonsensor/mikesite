I spent a lot of time a couple months back experimenting with the new version of Reaktor. It doesn't actually work on my studio computer because it requires Yosemite, so it was something I could handle while at home on my newer Macbook Air (which runs Reaktor surprisingly well). For a cover and the title, I blasphemed the only [Parvulus Infectus album](https://parvulusinfectus.bandcamp.com/album/the-mark-ov-force-unspoken) released while we were together. It's maybe inspired by Bowie's cover for *The Next Day*.

[Check it out here.](https://impercept.bandcamp.com/album/the-force-of-marcus-dont-speak-it)

![MARCUS]({{ '/img/marcus.jpg' | url }})

Have a listen, and maybe like [Impercept on Facebook](http://facebook.com/impercept) for more of my musical experiments that don't logically fit with one of my bands.
