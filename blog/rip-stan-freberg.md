I'll be honest, I wasn't sure that Stan Freberg was still alive when I heard the news he'd died yesterday (from Weird Al Yankovic's Instagram). But I spent a great deal of my childhood listening to him, thanks to my parents' taste for vintage comedy.

Of all the things that played in our house — like Paul Simon or Dave Brubeck or Louis Armstrong — Spike Jones and Stan Freberg stand out. Simon's inscrutable lyrics are not something a kid can identify with. But if you're even remotely aware of *Dragnet*, then Freberg's "St. George and the Dragonet" is a hoot.

So maybe I get just a little extra sad thinking about Stan Freberg than the average celebrity death. My mind free-associates his voices and sketches with my mother. But at the end of the day, his work is *funny*. It's clean, but not cheesy. It references pop culture of its time, but feels timeless.
