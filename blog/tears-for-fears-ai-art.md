[Tears for Fears is doubling down](https://www.stereogum.com/2281371/tears-for-fears-explain-why-ai-was-used-for-new-album-cover/news/) on using AI for the new live album cover. This is a little disappointing from a band I have a lot of respect and no small amount of love for. Perhaps they think they're not falling into the usual trap because they've paid someone. Never mind that person has scammed them with [one of the most typical images on the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=astronaut+in+sunflowers&iax=images&ia=images), whether human- or machine-generated. It's likely, given they haven't done a basic image search, that they're just old guys who don't know the state of things. And maybe they really don't care. It's a live album from a legacy act. But call me old fashioned or a commie or whatever, I think artists should support other artists.

The summary of my feelings on LLM-generated "art": There are so many things that machines can do to make our lives easier â€” and they should be doing them, so humans can be free to make things like art.
