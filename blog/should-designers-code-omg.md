[Good read](http://www.the-haystack.com/2015/09/02/put-the-designers-should-code-debate-to-rest/). The likelihood of that debate ever ending is small. But the point here is awesome. It's not about your skillset. It's about the fact that you're trying to describe a Picasso by farting.

>It took me several years to come to that opinion and it hasn’t changed much, but it wasn’t the coding that was important. It was the movement away from symbolic representations of that which we were designing. It was about not using flat images as a poor proxy for something that’s different for different people on different devices in different browsers.
