I sit here in my temporary housing, embracing the coziness of fall weather and its attendant sweaters and cocoas and whatnot, and face the prospect of being in a house without a dog to snuggle for the first time in around 20 years. Today we euthanized Cyrus, our absolute doof of a Boxer/Shepherd mix after a pretty darn long life and a much longer run with cancer than anyone expected.

He was certainly not always a good dog (friends who know about it... know about it), which only makes the feelings more complicated. And of course, when someone's life is in your hands, even a four-legged life, it's always complicated.

But we'll miss him a lot. Here's some pictures, mostly of him doing his one job: looking very sad with his Gregory Peck eyebrow.
