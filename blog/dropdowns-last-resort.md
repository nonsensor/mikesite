[I feel like this applies to desktop as well](https://storify.com/lukew/drop-downs-are-the-ui-of-last-resort). The idea of not hiding options is appealing. I wonder where along the way we (collectively) stopped putting radios out there — it's probably in the interest of keeping UIs "clean" and concise. But concise is a function of the actual design of fields and we need to fight for easier controls and fewer options, not a visually appealing mess.
