It occurs to me that I wrote this [post about trying Obsidian](/blog/a-better-way-to-keep-notes/) about a year ago. In that time, I have not really strayed from it, which is pretty unusual for me. I get really restless with tools. Thanks to a very active plugin community, theme ecosystem, and subreddit, it's become a great tool that is super customizable. I adapted a few times and that was no biggie at all thanks to the fact that Obsidian is based entirely around discrete files, stored in your file system, with their own regular ol' file names.

My current way of operating is shamefully trendy; I'm using Tiago Forte's *Building a Second Brain* as the methodology. One reason is that it works reasonably well with other tools including paper journaling and [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) bookmarks. Though he apparently uses Evernote and swears by its search (which is still quite good despite Evernote's many problems), I think the linking features in Obsidian are really what makes it good for this system. Knowledge doesn't just go in a filing cabinet and get dusty. You can always see it thanks to links and unlinked mentions.

I'm still not interested in changing, and as long as I am still locked into the old $5 rate for syncing, I will keep that as well.
