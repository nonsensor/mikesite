Eric Meyer on the CSS Working Group's attempts to add conditionals to CSS. My most recent side project uses pure CSS with variables, which is a huge step toward me not caring about preprocessors anymore. With logic, the only things left are concatenation (probably solved already), and nesting syntax, which I find cleaner to go through later on. He's right though, as a Sass user I can easily see both sides of this argument and don't know what's right. But I know it's progress, and in my current way of thinking, more features in CSS is better. Because no matter how "bloated" you think it'll be, it's still better than having to use extra tools that aren't natively parsed by the web browser.
