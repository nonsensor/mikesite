I love those kinds of blog posts where people talk about how it’s been a long time since they blogged. These are truly the great cultural moments we miss out on with a boring, centralized internet. I mean, how many people in music have died without me talking about how bummed out I am about it? Ozzy died, for heck’s sake. There hasn’t been one that bad since Prince, and I didn’t make a peep.

Some days you just don’t feel it. There’s no excuse, not even a particularly bad depressive episode or anything like that. Sometimes the lack of a CMS on this static site generator makes the barrier just a tiny bit too high. And sometimes, you burn your house down.

That’s an exaggeration, of course. I didn’t burn my house down. In fact, looking at it from the front, you might not even notice that it burned at all. But it doesn’t take a very close inspection to notice that it’s in pretty bad shape. We lost the living room and the bulk of the kitchen, while the rest of the place is pretty well wrecked by smoke damage.

It’s not particularly fun thinking back on the morning of. It was a rude awakening if there ever was one. The kids didn’t sleep well for quite a well, and frankly neither did I. But we’re snug in a furnished rental and trying to manage the cleanup and rebuild, which is going to be the number one factor in our lives for the next… almost a year. It definitely could’ve been worse — every couple days we experience the disappointment and low-level grief of some “thing” we’ve had for decades that is now lost, but the truth is most of the important stuff like family photos, valuable hard drives, etc. is safe. 

And so, as we settle in to a temporary life I hope to be ready to get goth about the next synth god’s death. Please, let’s protect Roger Linn.
