Here's cool video with Tony Visconti discussing the creation of "Heroes," the title song of maybe the best of Bowie's Berlin albums. It's amazing just to hear the multi tracks â€” Fripp's brilliant feedback guitar, the crack band, and Bowie's vocal takes, which get written about a lot but prove his power when you hear them on their own.

It'd be easy to take away that the era of true studio innovation with giant budgets and beautiful studios is mostly at an end so we'll never get great records like this anymore, but it's all there available to us. You could recreate so many of these things and more in your own house. The inspiration is what's important, and there's a lot of it in this video.
