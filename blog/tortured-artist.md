I hate it, but it has to come from somewhere. Sometimes Van Gogh gets blamed for it and maybe that's not without merit.

I guess at least he had the opportunity to achieve that calm and harmony, though he was by most accounts not wealthy or even comfortable. Modern life should afford more of this than the early industrial revolution, but we're spending our technological efforts teaching computers to paint the sunflowers instead of ourselves. Yes, I'm still ranting about that, and [shit like this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-25/microsoft-three-mile-island-deal-isn-t-a-nuclear-renaissance-at-least-not-yet) is not gonna make me stop anytime soon.

Also: I think the piece about love vs anger is important: it's lost so often because he's still thought of as "disagreeable."
