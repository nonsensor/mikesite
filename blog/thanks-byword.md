**UPDATE in 2024** Byword costs $11 now, but it's still here and still works great. Using Eleventy and writing mostly short posts, I tend to use a code editor now, but anything longer and out comes Byword.

[David Sparks still loves Byword](http://macsparky.com/blog/2014/12/byword-i-still-love-you) and by golly I do too. I write most everything that's longer than this post in it, although lately I've been running things through [Hemingway](http://hemingwayapp.com) as well.

I struggle with the hype that inevitably surrounds each new and shiny Markdown or RTF editor that costs $40. Most do literally nothing that Byword hasn't been doing for years now for five bucks.
