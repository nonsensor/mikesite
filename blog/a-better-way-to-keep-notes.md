title: A better way to keep notes

I'm definitely not alone here but finding the perfect toolset is a slight neurosis of mine. And I thought I had it with [Typora](http://mikepropst.com/blog/typora-for-windows), a flat, local markdown editor with a notebook view and cross-platform access. But along comes a reference to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — in our local Nextdoor of all places — and I feel finally ready to move things off Notion and out of the cloud.

![Obsidian]({{ '/img/obs_screenshot.png' | url }})

Obsidian has a lot of great features on top of being a markdown notebook, including: 
- web-less encrypted sync
- images
- CSS-based themes
- wiki-style internal linking 
- a nifty graph of all the links
- mobile version
- plugin architecture with a very active community

The one thing it lacks from Notion is a database, but increasingly I find that the kitchen-sink approach isn't working for me. I just want structured text with images, and I can go to LibreOffice Base or Airtable to organize data.
