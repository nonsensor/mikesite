[Nice look at Coil's first major opus, *Horse Rotorvator.*](https://heathenharvest.org/2016/03/13/theres-honey-in-the-hollows-coils-horse-rotorvator-30-years-on/) As always, there are multiple levels of meaning to everything, right down to the bandstand and references to dead horses on the cover. It's an album that survives and sounds amazingly strange and fresh to this day, despite the horribly dated synth horns.
