It's almost a little too on-the-nose: [A gallery piece](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/mar/20/artist-behind-monas-ladies-only-lounge-absolutely-delighted-man-is-suing-for-gender-discrimination) where women are permitted entry to view famous pieces of art while being served champagne and otherwise pampered, and men aren't allowed. It would be, anyway, if a man hadn't sued the artist over it. Hear that whooshing sound? If it wasn't actually playing out in Australian courts right now, I'd have speculated he was a plant by the artist.
