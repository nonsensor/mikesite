I haven't really noticed the downside of Sketch on the Mac App Store â€” except for the reason that I don't have the App Store version. Bohemian couldn't offer a Sketch 3 upgrade to App Store customers, so I got the standard version. Updates come very regularly, and apparently that's one of the major problems they have. I guess this trend has a chance of making Apple change some things. Sketch has to be a decent amount of lost revenue, and maybe more importantly, it's a high-profile Apple Design Award winning app.
