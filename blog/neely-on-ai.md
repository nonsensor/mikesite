Adam Neely often reveals a bit about his beliefs when he makes a video. He's spoken about the western-centricity of music theory and academic music, and how that neglects so many musical works and methods worth studying that come from other parts of the world. But he's never been more explicit than in this video, which in just its length reveals how much he seems to care about the subject.

And if you're not familiar with the connection between GenAI and the world of impending fascism as envisioned by guys like Curtis Yarvin or Peter Thiel, it's actually a pretty good introduction to the concept. 

Particularly resonant with me was the debunking of the concept that GenAI is somehow democratizing. It's always been in the interest of the moneyed and the major labels to make music seem like something that only a chosen class can do. That is what makes us consumers rather than creators, because consumers are an income stream and creators are the necessary evil to get to that income. Punk rock already taught us that we don't need that distinction. You can make music, and it doesn't matter what you have or don't have. You can do it.
