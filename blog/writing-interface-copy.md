[Great stuff from Nicole Fenton](http://nicolefenton.com/interface-writing/). This is a talk but translates well to a writeup.

UI copy gets the shaft so often, not just in terms of the attention it receives but also the way it's written.

> You write code iteratively, so why not the rest of it? It’s okay if your interface writing isn’t perfect. But you better believe that you need to go back and clean up those strings before you go live.

This is really important. Every project I've ever been a part of forgot the "we can improve later" mindset of Agile to some degree when faced with the prospect of launching with imperfect interface copy.
